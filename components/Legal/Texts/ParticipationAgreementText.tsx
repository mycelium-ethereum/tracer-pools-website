      <h2>Background</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Tracer DAO is a decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer
          ("Tracer"), an open source, blockchain-based financial protocol.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Tracer DAO relies on an experimental Smart Contract framework to
          manage a decentralised autonomous organisations where no one party is
          in control.
        </li>
        <li>
          The technical development of the Tracer DAO and Tracer will be
          achieved via a Governance Mechanism (defined further below) and
          managed via a Governance Token.
        </li>
        <li>
          Governance Tokens may be acquired during the Governance Period only by
          persons with sufficient technical and legal expertise to contribute
          their industry knowledge to the further development of the trading
          protocol, and who do not act as Consumers. It is only intended for
          users of blockchain technology and smart contract based software
          systems and only intended to be provided to individuals or entities
          that intend to actively participate in the Tracer DAO experiments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Governance Tokens allow holders to participate in the Tracer System
          via its Governance Mechanism and have no ownership or economic rights
          of any kind. By accepting this Agreement, you are agreeing that Tracer
          DAO’s Governance Tokens are not being viewed by you as an investment
          or a speculative asset.
