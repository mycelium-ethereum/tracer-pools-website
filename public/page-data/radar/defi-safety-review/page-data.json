Let's take a closer look at what the report entails. \n\n![tracer-defi-safety.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/tracer_defi_safety_4b47b254c3/tracer_defi_safety_4b47b254c3.png)\n\n### The Review Process\n\nFirst, it should be known DeFi Safety does not perform code audits. Instead, they review the quality of process and documentation behind the code, of which audits are only a part. For those interested in the Perpetual Pools code audit see the [Sigma Prime Audit](https://tracer.finance/radar/sigma-prime-audit-response).\n\n### Questions from the review\n\nThe report states: \"This is a Tracer Finance Process Quality Review completed on 14/10/2021. It was performed using the Process Review process (version 0.7.3) and is documented [here](https://docs.defisafety.com/review-process-documentation/process-quality-audit-process).\n\nThere are 5 categories within the review including the code & team, documentation, testing, security and access control. \n\nWith the exception of Q14, Q15, Q21, Q22, each question passed with flying colours. More granular details of the report can be found here: [Tracer Finance Process Quality Review](https://docs.defisafety.com/misc-and-in-work/tracer-finance-process-quality-review#code-and-team). \n\n### Code and the Team\n\n1.

Report of the results\n\nThe team will be adding an auto generated report of the test results to the repository. For now, if you wish to run the tests, you can use **yarn test** to do so.\n\n15. Formal Verification test done\n\nNo formal verification has been done on the codebase. We are currently finalising our V2 codebase with Runtime Verification. At the tail end of this audit we plan to have some more rigid loop invariants and to have performed more formal verification of the codebase.\n\n21. Is the information in non-technical terms that pertain to the investments?\n\nThe team will be releasing more documentation and an article outlining multisig control in Perpetual Pools V1, and how this is changing in Perpetual Pools V2.\n\n22. Is there Pause Control documentation including records of tests?\n\nMuch like above, this will be documented in an article released outlining some of the multisig use in Perpetual Pools V1 and V2.\n\nStay updated on Tracer's **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO)** and join the **[Discord](http://discord.gg/PYVs8rVPMd)** to connect with us and talk to the team, we're looking forward to hearing from you.","description":"Recently, an independent review of the Tracer protocol took place by DeFi Safety-  an independent ratings organization that evaluates Decentralized Finance products to produce an overarching security score based on transparency and adherence to best practices.","slug":"defi-safety-review","tagline":"The Results From Tracer's DeFi Safety Review","image":[{"formats":{"medium":{"url":"https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/medium_Defi_safety_review_a3a92be1e2/medium_Defi_safety_review_a3a92be1e2.png"}}}],"publish_date":"2021-11-10","read_time":4},"allStrapiTracerBlogs":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"Tracer-blogs_9","title":"The Tracer DAO Participation Agreement","body_text":"A decentralised autonomous organisation (“DAO”) is an entity whose decentralised governance is encoded in a smart contract framework.

Like traditional companies, DAOs have:\n\n1.  Bank accounts (called “treasuries”);\n2.  Formal governance (achieved by voting on “proposals”);\n3.  Stakeholders who participate in that governance (usually referred to as “governance token holders”, in the context of Tracer DAO, these are holders of the TCR token); and\n4.  The ability to engage third parties (called “service providers”).\n\nDAOs often do not have “managers” or “directors” and are owned and controlled by their governance token holders. For this reason, DAOs are analogous to member-managed companies, which exist only in some jurisdictions. Nobody understands this analogy better than the team at [OpenLaw](https://www.openlaw.io/) who used a Delaware member-managed LLC to “wrap” a DAO, thereby creating [The LAO](https://www.openlaw.io/), which is the first for-profit, limited liability, decentralised autonomous organisation. However, as a relatively new way of conducting business, leveraging relatively new technology, when a DAO is deployed on-chain it will not be recognised as an entity with legal personality or limited liability. Until such recognition, we are left with DAOs who do not operate as people within the eyes of the law. Currently, most legal minds interpret DAOs as unregistered organisations, unincorporated associations or general partnerships. These interpretations each lead to concerns that, amongst an organisation of potentially infinite parties, each individual party could be held personally liable for the debts of the organisation.\n\n![The_LAO.](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/The_LAO_91f4cd4a87/The_LAO_91f4cd4a87.gif)\n> \n> OpenLaw’s LAO was a step in the right direction for DAO recognition.\n\nDevelopment is underway in the international law arena, where the [Coalition Of Automated Legal Applications](https://coala.global/) (**_COALA_**) has been working on [The DAO Model Law](https://medium.com/coala/the-dao-model-law-68e5360971ea). The goal of the model law is to assist jurisdictions in crafting their own DAO laws, so as to recognise full or partial legal personality to DAOs. We have already seen signs of a shift in some jurisdictions, such as [Wyoming](https://defirate.com/wyoming-dao-bill/) and [Malta](https://chainstrategies.com/2018/03/11/malta-blockchain-regulation-proposal-legal-personality-for-daos-and-smart-contracts/), but we generally advise against holding your breach while waiting for legal and regulatory wheels to turn. In the case of Wyoming, the “[DAO Bill](https://defirate.com/wyoming-dao-bill/)”, recently approved by the Senate, allows DAOs to register themselves as LLCs and provides a framework for their formation and management. [Otonomos](https://otonomos.com/)' most recent newsletter considers this framework and queries: “What does the DAO Bill add that contract law cannot provide?”\n\n**What is a Participation Agreement?**\n\nA Participation Agreement uses contract law to provide a framework for the formation and management of a DAO and govern the rights and obligations of each member of the DAO, including governance token holders and service providers. With respect to the Tracer DAO Participation Agreement, some important features of the Participation Agreement include:\n\n1.  An explanation of Tracer DAO’s governance mechanism;\n2.  DAO members releasing other DAO members from claims arising in connection with the Tracer project;\n3.  DAO members waiving their claims against other DAO members;\n4.  A limitation of liability for DAO members in relation to loss or damage arising under or in connection with the use of Tracer’s contracts; and\n5.  In-built complaints and dispute resolution procedures for problems and disputes arising in connection with the Tracer project.\n\n![Participation Agreement.](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Screenshot_Participation_Agreement_a53f3b6523/Screenshot_Participation_Agreement_a53f3b6523.png)\n> \n> The clauses of the Tracer DAO Participation Agreement.\n\nThe limited liability status offered to companies allows those companies to better manage risk associated with civil claims which may arise between that entity and its various shareholders, employees, contractors and service providers. Similarly, Participation Agreements allow DAOs to better manage risk associated with civil claims which may arise between governance token holders and service providers of the DAO (ie, those parties impacted by the operations of the DAO).\n\n**How is the Participation Agreement signed?**\n\nA potential DAO member of Tracer DAO will digitally sign the Participation Agreement when they submit a transaction to the DAO contract on the Ethereum blockchain (eg, claiming TCR tokens) which includes the Participation Agreement. Each DAO member will be a party to the Participation Agreement.\n\n![Tracer Logo Banner.](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/TCR_Logo_Participation_Agreement_bc485ea2e2/TCR_Logo_Participation_Agreement_bc485ea2e2.png)\n> \n> Each member of Tracer DAO is party to the Participation Agreement.\n\nThe Tracer DAO Participation Agreement is not the first of its kind. It is inspired by the [dxDAO Participation Agreement](https://dutchx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dxDAO.html), published by [Gnosis](https://gnosis.io/). A similar agreement was also used by the Ethfinex team for [The Nectar DAO](https://nectar.community/dao#).\n\n**The path ahead.**\n\nParticipation agreements are important in enabling DAOs to operate as sophisticated entities. The authorship of the Tracer DAO Participation Agreement contributes to an already rich DAO history and accords with Tracer DAO’s broader purpose: to provide strong foundations for future financial innovation. Tracer DAO will continue to evolve with the demands of both its members and the broader market. Its leadership and innovation will serve as a source of guidance for future DAOs.","description":"A decentralised autonomous organisation (“DAO”) is an entity whose decentralised governance is encoded in a smart contract framework.

Tracer will be deploying its Perpetual Swaps on [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) in the coming month. The following read will give you a thorough understanding of the mechanisms that power Arbitrum to give you more comfort and understanding when trading on Tracer in an L2 environment.\n\n**UPDATE:** Tracer [Perpetual Pools](https://pools.tracer.finance/) is now live on Arbitrum One\n\n## Architecture Summary\n\n*   As Arbitrum (L2) exists as a scalability solution for Ethereum (L1), the Arbitrum architecture naturally exists in part on L1 and in part on L2.\n*   The component of Arbitrum that exists on L1 is the EthBridge, which is a set of Ethereum contracts.\n*   The EthBridge is responsible for refereeing the Arbitrum Rollup protocol, as well as maintaining the inbox and outbox of the chain.\n*   The inbox and outbox of a chain is what allows users, L1 contracts, and full nodes to send their transactions to the chain as well as observing the outcome of those transactions.\n*   The Arbitrum Virtual Machine is the gateway between L1 and L2, and the function provided by the EthBridge.\n*   The AVM is what is capable of reading inputs, and executing computations on these inputs to produce outputs.\n*   ArbOS is run on top of the Arbitrum Virtual Machine, and is responsible for ensuring the execution of smart contracts on the Arbitrum chain.\n*   ArbOS exists completely on L2, and runs EVM contracts just like how they would be run on Ethereum.\n\n![Layer 1 to Layer 2.](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/diagram_1_9294177094/diagram_1_9294177094.png)\n\n> A high level view of the Arbitrum architecture.\n\n## The Rollup protocol\n\n*   The order of messages in the chain’s inbox determines the result of the transactions.\n    *   Subsequently, anyone who is watching the inbox is able to know the results of the transactions, simply by self-executing them.\n*   The Rollup protocol is responsible for confirming the results of transactions that have effectively already occurred.\n*   Users that participate in the protocol are called validators; if a validator stakes Eth into a deposit contract, they become a staker and can stake on blocks in the Rollup chain.\n    *   Both the roles of validator and staker are permissionless.\n*   In terms of security, only a single honest validator is required to force the correct execution of the chain.\n    *   This gives the rollup chain the same degree of trustlessness as the Ethereum main chain.\n    *   Arbitrum assumes the existence of at least one honest validator.\n*   The Rollup protocol acts upon the Rollup chain, which is a chain of rollup blocks existing separately to the Ethereum chain.\n*   It is the role of the validators to propose new blocks to be added to the chain.\n*   Every block that is proposed will eventually be confirmed or rejected by the protocol.\n*   Each block is made up of a number of fields, and apart from the block number field, the data given in each of these fields are assertions made by the block’s proposer which may or may not be correct.\n    *   If any of the asserted fields are incorrect, the protocol will eventually reject the block.\n*   Once a block is proposed it receives a deadline for confirmation.\n*   If a validator disagrees with the block, they should propose their own correct block which earns the honest validator some reward when they eventually end up in a fraud proof with the incorrect block.\n\n## Staking\n\n*   For a staker to add a rollup block to the chain, they must place their stake on the block they are adding.\n*   Staking is permissionless, anyone can stake on any block where staking is possible.\n*   Once you are staked on a block you cannot withdraw your stake until that block has been confirmed.\n*   When you stake a block, you are confirming that a block is correct, AND every block in the chain between the most recent confirmed block and the block that you are staking is correct.\n*   If a block that you stake on is incorrect, or a block in the chain between the most recent confirmed block and the block that you are staking on is incorrect, you will forfeit your stake.\n*   If you are not staked on a block, you can stake on the most recent confirmed block.\n*   If you are staked on a rollup block, you can extend your stake up to any successor of the block you are staked on.\n*   The amount needed to stake is dynamic.\n    *   There is the base stake amount that is specified as a parameter in the Arbitrum chain, which will be used most of the time.\n    *   As a security measure to prevent an attacker slowing down the network despite losing their stake, the stake amount is multiplied by a factor that increases exponentially with respect to time, since the deadline for the first unresolved node passed.\n    *   This is to increase the cost of such an attack during the length of the attack.\n    *   This increase in stake is temporary and only occurs when the chain is making slow progress to confirm blocks.\n\n## Challenge protocol\n\n*   When two stakers are staked on different blocks, where one block is not a successor of the other, there will be a particular block that they disagree on and a challenge will occur.\n*   Most of the challenge occurs on the Arbitrum chain and is refereed by a L1 contract.\n*   The challenge consists of an interactive, multi-round dissection game that occurs on L2, and a one-step proof that is executed on L1.\n*   The staker who proposed the disputed block is defending their assertion against a disagreeing staker.\n*   The defending staker is essentially claiming that by starting at the preceding block, after some N instructions are executed by the virtual machine, the preceding block state will have been advanced to the state given in their proposed block.\n*   The defending staker (Alice) will make the first move in the dissection game by dissecting the N instruction into K parts of size N/K.\n    *   Note that the subsections are not equal in size with respect to the number of steps, but rather equal in size with respect to the amount of Arbgas consumed.\n    *   Also note that each segment will naturally have a start-point and an end-point (this is trivial, but makes the next dot-point easier to understand).\n*   The opposing staker (Bob) will also dissect the set of instructions into K parts of size N/K, except one of Bob’s K segments will have a different end-point to Alice’s corresponding segment’s end-point.\n    *   This is essentially Bob identifying the segment with which he disagrees.\n*   Bob will then perform the same action as Alice’s initial step and dissect one of the segments into K subsegments of size N/K, and send this segment with identified subsegments back to Alice.\n*   Alice then performs the same action as Bob’s initial step and identifies a subsegment where she disagrees with its end-point.\n*   This dissection process continues until Alice and Bob have identified a single instruction on which they disagree.\n*   This instruction is sent to a L1 contract which executes it and decides the winner of the dispute.\n*   The loser of the dispute will have their stake confiscated, part of which will be burnt - to avoid an attacker hedging their bets - and the remainder of the stake will be given to the honest staker as a reward.\n*   During the whole dissection process, the L1 contract that is refereeing the game does not know any information about the instructions themselves, it is only checking that each player is following the rules of the dissection game.\n*   During the dispute, all other validators are able to determine for themselves the result of the dispute before the dispute is finalised; meaning that essentially a soft fork occurs and the validators can continue to submit rollup blocks on the correct chain.\n*   The challenge period has an imposed time limit of roughly one week per staker.\n*   Each staker must make all of their moves within their week allocation or they will lose the dispute.\n    *   Think of a chess clock.\n\n![Multi-round](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/diagram_2_5b56f13345/diagram_2_5b56f13345.png)\n\n> A demonstration of the multi-round, interactive disection game played by two stakers during the challenge protocol. In reality, the disputed assertion will have many more instructions (rows with squiggles in it) and thus more rounds will be played but the principle is the same.\n\n## Validators\n\n*   A validator is a node on the Arbitrum chain that has chosen to watch the activity of the Rollup protocol and advance the state of the chain.\n    *   Not all nodes act as validators.\n*   Offchain Labs expect validators to follow either an active, defensive, or watchtower strategy; although, this is not enforced by the protocol.\n    *   An ‘active validator’ is continuously working to advance the chain by proposing new blocks. Only one honest active validator is required per chain; increasing the number of active validators does not increase the efficiency of the chain.\n    *   A ‘defensive validator’ watches the Rollup protocol and acts only when they witness dishonest behaviour, at which point they will either propose a correct block - or if a correct block has already been proposed - they will stake on that block.\n    *   A ‘watch tower validator’ watches the Rollup protocol just like a defensive validator, but if they witness dishonest behaviour they don’t propose or stake on a correct block themselves, rather they simply alert other validators to do so.\n*   Offchain labs will run an active validator on their flagship Arbitrum chain.\n*   For most of the time, defensive and watchtower validators will not need to do anything, hence an attacker is never aware of how many defensive validators there are.\n*   Although anyone can be a validator, it is expected that the main parties who will choose to become one will be parties who have significant assets invested in the chain, or parties who are hired to be validators by those with significant investments.\n\n## Full Nodes\n\n*   A full node on Arbitrum has the same role as a full node on Ethereum; they track the state of the chain and allow others to interact with the chain\n*   Due to a built-in AVM emulator, a full node is able to treat the chain as a matter of computing outputs from inputs, without any knowledge of the actual Rollup protocol.\n*   A full node can serve as an aggregator on the chain, further increasing cost efficiency for the users.\n*   Arbitrum includes the facility to collect fees from users to compensate the full node for the costs incurred while acting as an aggregator.\n*   Full nodes can also compress transactions to further decrease the L1 calldata cost.\n    *   The full node submits the compressed transaction to the chain’s inbox, where arbOS receives it and uncompresses the transaction.\n*   A full node will typically incorporate both compression and aggregation, i.e. it will submit a batch of compressed transactions to the chain’s inbox.\n\n## Sequencer Mode\n\n*   When an Arbitrum chain is launched, there is the option to launch with a sequencer.\n*   A sequencer is a full node that has additional privileges for the ordering of transactions in the chain’s inbox.\n*   These privileges allow the sequencer to instantly guarantee the result of a transaction.\n*   When an Arbitrum chain is launched with a sequencer, the chain inbox is effectively split in two:\n    *   One inbox will operate as it normally would if there was no sequencer, i.e. nodes can send messages to the inbox which will be tagged with a block number and timestamp.\n    *   The second inbox will be controlled by the sequencer, and only the sequencer can send messages to this inbox\n*   When the sequencer sends messages to their inbox, they can specify the block number and timestamp with which to tag the message.\n    *   This includes block numbers and timestamps from the past, up to a specified delta_blocks, blocks in the past and delta_seconds, seconds in the past.\n    *   These delta values will typically correspond to roughly ten minutes of wall-clock time.\n*   Now when arbOS checks the inbox, it will receive the message with the lowest block number, which may be at the head of either the regular inbox or the sequencer inbox.\n*   The limit on how far back the sequencer can backdate blocks is tied to the number of confirmation blocks needed to achieve finality on Ethereum.\n    *   If x amount of blocks are needed to achieve finality on Ethereum, then the sequencer will backdate by x blocks so that it knows exactly which transactions will precede its current transaction.\n*   When sequencer mode is activated on an Arbitrum chain, transactions that are submitted to the sequencer will achieve finality x blocks faster than it would if there was no sequencer, but transactions that are submitted to the regular inbox will achieve finality x blocks slower than if there was no sequencer.\n    *   This is regarded as a positive trade-off due to the large practical difference when comparing instant and five minute finality with five minute and ten minute finality.\n*   However, a malicious sequencer is able to take advantage of these privileges to a certain extent.\n    *   A malicious sequencer is able to censor user’s transactions by simply not including them to the sequencer inbox, forcing the user to send the same transactions to the regular inbox after realising that they have been censored.\n    *   The sequencer would also have the power to frontrun user’s transactions.\n*   The initial Arbitrum chain will launch with a sequencer that is run by Offchain Labs.\n*   There has previously been some successful research into developing a decentralised fair sequencer algorithm by a team at Cornell Tech, and with some more work this will form the long term solution for Arbitrum.\n\n![with and without a sequencer](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/diagram_3_764350ae06/diagram_3_764350ae06.png)\n\n> The difference in the chain’s inbox when the sequencer mode is enabled / disabled.\n\n## ArbGas / Fees\n\n*   ArbGas operates similarly to Ethereum gas in that it is used to measure the cost of computation on the Arbitrum chain.\n*   However, there is no hard ArbGas limit imposed on an Arbitrum chain, and ArbGas can be consumed much faster than Ethereum gas.\n*   A key role of ArbGas is to provide a predictable measure of how long it would take to validate the result of a computation.\n*   Every rollup block includes a claim about the total amount of ArbGas consumed in the chain, meaning that the difference between the current block’s claim and the previous block’s claim should be a valid indicator of how much ArbGas is consumed in the current block.\n*   This way, a validator who is checking a block’s validity can set their gas limit to this amount, and if they run out of ArbGas before they reach the end of the block, they can be certain that they have identified an invalid block and successfully challenge it.\n*   Users are charged fees when they submit their transactions to the chain.\n*   If the user sends their transaction to an aggregator, a portion of the fees is automatically paid to that aggregator for costs they incurred.\n*   The remainder of the fees is sent to a network fee pool which is used to pay for services that ensure that the chain operates securely.\n*   Fees are charged for L2 transactions, L1 calldata, computation, and storage.\n*   Fees are paid in Eth.\n\n## Summary\n\n*   Arbitrum is a L2 scalability solution developed by Offchain Labs: an optimistic rollup that uses a multi-round interactive challenge protocol.\n*   The flagship Arbitrum chain was released to developers on the 28th of May, and will be open to users once a quorum of projects has been reached.\n*   From the User’s point of view, interacting with the Arbitrum chain will be an identical experience to interacting with Ethereum.\n\nTracer will be deploying its Perpetual Swaps on

Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) was a notable member of the House Committee’s panel.\n\n<iframe class=\"blog-video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vX2X8xxHEns\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n\n> Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide, Part III. May 6, 2021.\n\nThe hearing was the latest in a series examining the extreme market volatility witnessed in early 2021, much of which stemmed from a short squeeze on stocks, including GameStop, AMC, Koss, and others. Specifically, it contemplated the implications of retail investors using popular social media forums like Reddit’s “WallStreetBets” subchannel to collectively induce a short squeeze in stocks they identified as being heavily shorted by hedge funds.\n\nA spattering of topics were covered in the hearing, including: the payment for order flow model, the market-dominance of a few powerful participants, gamification of retail investing, and the growing impact of social media and technology on America’s capital markets.\n\nSome of these head-scratching issues are age-old, some are novel, but they are all genuine issues that warrant discussion. Tracer believes this discussion should not be relegated to a minority whose job it is to contemplate and regulate, but instead be shared throughout the market.\n\nKeep an eye out for Episode 2 of the ‘Education in Regulation’ series to read our thought piece on increased market participation and whether increased regulation is necessary to manage that reality.

We’ll run you step-by-step through Perpetual Pools usage basics; then we’ll highlight a proposed liquidity mining incentive structure suitable for Perpetual Pools.\n\nSo, what are Perpetual Pools? [Read the Tracer: Perpetual Pools Litepaper](https://tracer.finance/media/white-papers/perp-pools/perpetual-pools.pdf).\n\n\n## Overview\n\nPerpetual Pools is a new financial primitive that enables anybody to take a short or long position on any underlying asset. These positions are non-liquidatable, fully\ncollateralised, fully-fungible and can exist perpetually without upkeep. By taking a position, users mint fungible ERC20 tokens representing ownership of the pool of assets. These fungible positions allow users to interact with the DeFi economy seamlessly and sustain their leveraged exposure.\n\nPerpetual Pools is a financial contract for the transfer of value between **long** and **short** sides of a collateral pool, based on an underlying price feed. For example, a long user places collateral into the long side to mint an **L-token**. A short user will have the same interaction with the short side, and mint an **S-token**.\n\nThe value of these tokens is determined by the proportion of collateral held in each side of the pool. Periodically (eg, each hour), value will transfer from one side to another based on a transfer function which mimics leveraged exposure. This is what we call power leverage. Denoted as p.\n\n**Example**\n\n> *Take a 1-BTC/USDC pool. For this pool there is a long side and a short side. The long side is represented by an L-token, and the short side is represented\nby an S-token. Users who intend to take a long position on BTC/USDC will purchase an L-token. Users who intend to take a short position on BTC/USDC will purchase an S-token.*\n\n![PPLite_twitter_02_D01_3-01.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/PP_Lite_twitter_02_D01_3_01_c8204316d9/PP_Lite_twitter_02_D01_3_01_c8204316d9.png)\n\n> *In the case where the BTC price goes up, the short side will transfer some of its USDC to the long side. As such, the L-token price appreciation will act like traditional leverage (1x in this case) for normal price movements. The S-token price depreciation will also act like traditional leverage (1x in this case) for normal price movements.*\n\n![PPLite_twitter_03_D01_6-01.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/PP_Lite_twitter_03_D01_6_01_7ad2245d4e/PP_Lite_twitter_03_D01_6_01_7ad2245d4e.png)\n\n\n## Rebalancing Rate\n\nIn the case where long and short collateral is at parity, an x% transfer from one side will equate to an x% gain for the other side. However, in the case where long and short collateral is not equal, an x% transfer from one side will not result in an x% gain for the other side. Instead, the side’s gain is adjusted by the **rebalancing rate**. A favourable rebalancing rate presents asymmetric upside for the less collateralised side.\n\n![PPLite_twitter_graphs-04.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_04_4609070d78/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_04_4609070d78.png)\n\n\nThe existence of this rebalancing rate will mean that liquidity providers on the under-collateralised side will have **amplified leveraged gains** while keeping their losses fixed. e.g., for a 1p pool with a rebalance rate of 10%, the short side will have a power leverage of **1.1p for gains** while only *1p for their losses*.\n\n\n### Use Cases\n\nHere we detail basic use-cases for Perpetual Pools. We intend to provide more sophisticated strategies, both at an informational level as well as strategies for users to stake or earn yield:\n\n**Directional Positions:** Take one side of a pool and indicate your beliefs to the market at varied leverages.\n\n**Rebalancing Rate Returns:** Farming asymmetric returns that arise from the rebalancing rate.\n\n**Long Straddle Payout:** Buy equal notional value of L/S-tokens, and profit if the price moves in one direction.\n\n**Liquidity Provision for Secondary Markets:** Take both sides of the pool and generate revenue through secondary market (swap) fees.\n\n\n## TCR Distribution\n\nTracer DAO proposes to distribute TCR to liquidity miners based on an initial 5 year forecast. See the graph below. The 64.7% represents the current initiatives already passed and voted, or proposed and currently in the execution phase, leaving 35.3% remaining for distribution. We project that, from the Perpetual Pools liquidity mining distribution, 50% will be allocated within the first 6 months, while the remaining balance will be emitted over the remaining 4.5 years.\n\n![PPLite_twitter_graphs-03.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_03_d3fe312e92/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_03_d3fe312e92.png)\n\n\nPerpetual Pools reimagine the way that derivative contracts function and position Tracer as a pioneering protocol on the bleeding edge of financial innovation. As Tracer DAO's beachhead contract type, Perpetual Pools must be tested and adopted by community members, builders and market participants. Accordingly, Tracer DAO will seek to incentivise these kinds of behaviour.\n\n\n## Liquidity Mining\n\nSentiment among Tracer DAO community members ([Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/current-and-future-token-distribution/224)) is to introduce Liquidity Mining incentives for providers at market genesis. See below an example schedule projection of liquidity mining in the context of Tracer DAO’s Perpetual Pools contracts.\n\n\n![PPLite_twitter_graphs-01.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_01_c9da5c19c2/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_01_c9da5c19c2.png)\n\n\nFrom the day of launch, liquidity providers will receive a concentrated distribution of TCR, where 57% (out of the allocated 5%) will be distributed in the first 4 weeks following launch. The alignment between TCR token holders and Tracer DAO stakeholder primacy is crucial for successful decentralised governance and it will ultimately deliver a stronger Tracer DAO.\n\n\n## How will it work?\n\nThere will be two methods of liquidity mining. One that incentivises Primary Market Liquidity (i.e. buying a pool token), and one that incentivises Secondary Market Liquidity (i.e. putting that pool token into an AMM liquidity pool).\n\nTCR will be allocated to both Primary Market Liquidity and Secondary Market Liquidity. At genesis, 40% of TCR allocation will be given to Primary Market Liquidity, and 60% will be given to Secondary Market Liquidity.\n \n\n- The TCR Allocation (Primary Market) and the TCR Allocation (Secondary Market) will be a configurable parameter which can be adjusted depending on market conditions.\n\nTo earn *Primary Market Liquidity Rewards*, users will stake a pool token(s). To earn *Secondary Market Liquidity Rewards* users will stake an appropriate AMM LP token(s) into the staking farm contract.\n\nIn this model, 2.85% of total TCR supply (1B TCR) will be distributed within the first 4 weeks of the liquidity mining scheme.\n\n**Please Note:** Users will need to use the Arbitrum bridge [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) to move their assets from L1 to L2 when using the Perpetual Pools Interface. Also, noting the 7-day withdrawal timeframe back to main-chain (L2 to L1)\n\n\n## What is the allocation?\n\nLiquidity mining rewards are calculated at the end of each Rebalance Period (60-minutes).\n\nFor *Primary Market Liquidity Rewards*, the liquidity mining rewards are determined by the proportion of pool tokens provided by the unique address in the staking farm contract.\n\n- e.g. User deposits five 1L-ETH/USDC. There are a total of 100 1L-ETH/USDC.\nTherefore, this user has a 5% claim on the TCR rewards for that hour.\n\nThe same logic applies for staking AMM LP tokens.\n\n\n## What is the schedule?\n\nNo vesting for TCR rewards. Rewards will accrue continuously and can be claimed at any time. TCR is earned continuously.\n\n- e.g. for the first week, the contract will release a total of 8,000,000 TCR. This will be released continuously.\n\n A new rate is given weekly.\n\n- e.g. for the second week, there will be 7,500,000 TCR emitted.\n\n\n## Markets at Launch\n\nThe initial Perpetual Pool markets proposed to be deployed will be 1-BTC/USDC, 3-BTC/USDC, 1-ETH/USDC and 3-ETH/USDC.\n\n\n## Secondary Markets\n\nThese are fungible tokens: positions in a Perpetual Pool can be used for further yield-bearing opportunities. For example, a long/short user can provide liquidity in a Balancer, SushiSwap or Uniswap AMM to earn returns from swap fees over time. We expect secondary markets to be naturally liquid as users seek these fees.\n\n\n## Timeline\n\nHere’s the current and forecast timeline for Tracer DAO:\n\n![PPLite_twitter_graphs-02.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_02_296c15568f/PP_Lite_twitter_graphs_02_296c15568f.png)\n\n\n## What Happens Next?\n\nStay tuned by following Tracer DAO on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO) and jumping into the community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kvJEwfvyrW) and [Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/current-and-future-token-distribution/224).\n\n\n\n### Legal and Financial Advice Disclaimer:\n\nThe information provided in this article is for informational purposes only.

A number of innovations in organisational structure have emerged from the rapid rise in both DAO use and popularity. Via its novel approach to engage Service Providers, [Tracer DAO](https://tracer.finance/) is contributing to the swell of new-age innovation in corporate restructuring.\n\n### What is a Service Provider?\n\nA similarity between DAOs and their traditional corporate ancestors is the ability to engage third-parties. Different DAOs use different labels, but in Tracer DAO’s context these third-parties are known as “Service Providers”. As the name suggests, these parties are engaged by DAOs to provide an agreed service. The consideration received for the provision of services is determined at the discretion of the proposing DAO member and will flow as tokens from the DAO’s treasury. It is also possible for a Service Provider to receive Tracer DAO's TCR governance tokens as consideration. Service Providers who receive TCR tokens as consideration for some, or all, of their services will automatically become members of the DAO, and have the ability to make Proposals, vote on future Proposals, and thereby manage Tracer’s governance mechanism, financial contracts and other protocols. A Service Provider holding governance tokens is consistent with the notion of stakeholder primacy, whereby that Service Provider will be held accountable by all stakeholders within the Tracer ecosystem, and is incentivised to perform services with the highest level of quality, become more active within the Tracer ecosystem, and use their knowledge and learnings to inform future decisions through acts of governance.\n\n![TCR_Logo_Participation_Agreement.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/TCR_Logo_Participation_Agreement_bc485ea2e2/TCR_Logo_Participation_Agreement_bc485ea2e2.png)\n\n> Tracer DAO Engages “Service Providers” to Contribute to the Ecosystem\n\nThe engagement of Service Providers is voted on by Tracer’s DAO members via its Proposal mechanism. Open forum discussion with the general public on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kvJEwfvyrW) and [Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/) determines the interest in, and the terms of, the Proposals. All DAO members have rights to propose and vote on governance decisions. Generally, records of DAO decisions are recorded on a public blockchain and governance interface. In the case of Tracer, decisions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and [Tracer’s Governance App](https://gov.tracer.finance/#/). The transparent manner in which governance is conducted is a hallmark of DAOs and one of their most exciting features.\n\n### Who are Tracer DAO’s current Service Providers?\n\nTracer DAO started with 100 distributed members who claimed TCR governance tokens from the DAO contract between 6 January 2021 and 27 January 2021.\n\nSince then, Tracer DAO has engaged a variety of Service Providers. The first was [Lion's Mane](https://lionsmane.eth.link/), engaged on 10 February 2021\\. Lion’s Mane is a pride of hackers, crypto economists and open-source ideologues. The team was engaged to (among other things) develop smart contracts and aid Tracer DAO’s marketing and communications efforts.\n\nOn 19 March 2021, [Sigma Prime](https://sigmaprime.io/) was engaged to conduct an initial audit of Tracer’s Perpetual Swap smart contract codebase. Importantly, the executed Service Agreement between Sigma Prime and Tracer DAO, dated 19 March 2021, includes a “digital signature” in the form of the [Ethereum transaction hash](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6a6e6c94dbb0d892b3689844ac3669ebb79c8eda6c418f9f2fa0d96626f74b1a) from the successful Proposal. This was the first legal document to have a DAO as a signatory, supporting the precedent that DAOs can contract directly with Service Providers.\n\nMost recently, [RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub](https://rmitblockchain.io/) proposed a research collaboration with Tracer DAO for the development of governance and cryptoeconomic design relating to Tracer and Tracer DAO. This was [successfully approved](https://vote.tracer.finance/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmUaFtGvtTa5cwHyG68K1MFbSjv1hL5f6oJqTcATe1cYfU) by Tracer DAO on 30 March 2021, and RMIT’s work is now underway.\n\n![Tracer_DAO_Current.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_DAO_Current_90c6c5e573/Tracer_DAO_Current_90c6c5e573.png)\n\n### How do I become a Service Provider?\n\nService Providers who can add value to the Tracer ecosystem are encouraged to articulate that value to the Tracer DAO. Tracer’s community is already vibrant and increased talent and experience will continue to make it stronger. If you believe that you are well positioned to contribute to Tracer’s ecosystem, be sure to make it known and help Tracer realise its destiny as the future of financial infrastructure.\n\n**Step 1: Submit an EOI.**\n\nThe first step for parties interested in working for Tracer DAO is to present their offering via an Expression of Interest (EOI), located under the [EOI category in Tracer’s Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/c/dao-proposals/expression-of-interest/14).\n\nPreviously appointed Service Providers have drafted EOIs with the following kinds of information, and we encourage you to do the same:\n\n1.  Entity introduction;\n2.  Team member introductions;\n3.  Envisioned collaboration with Tracer DAO, detailing services to be performed; and\n4.  Previous work experience.\n\n![Tracer_DAO_Availability.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_DAO_Availability_8247330597/Tracer_DAO_Availability_8247330597.png)\n\nAn example EOI has [recently been published](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/collaboration-between-tracer-dao-and-defi-pulse/180) by [DeFi Pulse](https://defipulse.com/). In this case, DeFi Pulse seek to be engaged by Tracer DAO as a Service Provider to provide services including content delivery. Their content offering focusses on educating future users about technical updates, feature improvements, and statistical analysis of the Tracer protocol.\n\nThe success of the Tracer project is dependent on engaging talented Service Providers. If the Tracer project aligns with your skills and offering, Tracer DAO invites you to submit an EOI.\n\n**Step 2: Draft a Proposal, await DAO member submission.**\n\nIf interest is gained on the EOI, a community member, including the potential Service Provider, may prepare a draft Proposal in Tracer’s [Proposal Lobby](https://discourse.tracer.finance/c/dao-proposals/proposal-lobby/13) where it will be open for discussion. The process for creating a Tracer DAO Proposal has been detailed in a previous [Discourse Post](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/how-to-create-a-tracer-dao-proposal/198).\n\n**Step 3: Formal Proposal submitted on Snapshot.**\n\nAt any point in time, a DAO member may formally submit the Proposal on [Tracer’s Snapshot instance](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth) to begin the voting process.\n\n**Step 4: Proposal submitted on-chain.**\n\nOnce the result of the Snapshot proposal has become apparent, a DAO member can make a proposal on-chain using the [Tracer Governance App](https://gov.tracer.finance/#/proposal/new).\n\nIf the [Tracer Governance App](https://gov.tracer.finance/#/proposal/new) does not support the functionality of the relevant Proposal, the DAO member making the Proposal will need to generate the data separately. This is most easily done using Web3.js with the `encodeFunctionCall` function. An example of this being done can be found [in the tracer-dao Github repository](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-dao/blob/master/test/LionsmaneProposal.js#L73). Any roadblocks at this stage in the process should be brought to Tracer’s Discord or Discourse.\n\nOnce the data has been generated, the DAO member must then call the DAO’s `propose` function, which can be found on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa84918f3280d488eb3369cb713ec53ce386b6cba#writeProxyContract). The implementation can be read [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ad0a0814f5fd76be6bdc0b771df98aafd572107/advanced#code). The function must be called with:\n\n*   `targets` set to the list of function execution targets (the addresses of the contracts whose functions will be called);\n*   `proposalData` set to the list of encoded function data;\n*   `allowMultisig` set to true; and\n*   `proposalURI` set to the IPFS hash of the proposal (this will usually be the IPFS hash of the Snapshot proposal).\n\nAgain, an example of how to call `propose` can be found [in the tracer-dao Github repository](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-dao/blob/master/test/LionsmaneProposal.js).\n\n### What's the relationship between Tracer DAO and its Service Providers?\n\nThe legal status of DAOs in most jurisdictions poses an obstacle to their wider adoption. Currently, most legal minds interpret DAOs as unregistered organisations, unincorporated associations, or general partnerships. One innovation intended to address this issue is a Participation Agreement.\n\nThe Tracer DAO Participation Agreement was explained in a previous [Radar post](https://tracer.finance/radar/dao-participation/). A Participation Agreement uses contract law to provide a framework for the formation and management of a DAO; specifically, the rights and obligations of each member of the DAO. This is precisely where the concept of a “Service Provider” comes from.\n\n![DAO_participation_Agreement (1).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/DAO_participation_Agreement_1_c006642051/DAO_participation_Agreement_1_c006642051.png)\n\n> The Beginning of the Tracer DAO Participation Agreement\n\nTracer DAO’s Participation Agreement provides crucial clarity in respect to the relationship between Tracer DAO and its Service Providers. Notably, the Agreement releases Service Providers from claims made by other DAO members that arise in connection with the Tracer project. Furthermore, it guarantees that Service Providers will not be liable for losses arising under, or in relation to, the DAOs activities. The Agreement is embedded in Tracer’s smart contracts. It's included there to shed a welcome light on the rights and obligations of Service Providers in the Tracer DAO ecosystem.\n\nApplications to join Tracer DAO as a Governor are open.

Brokerages charge high fee rates for international market access and additional licensing can prove costly and difficult to attain. Contract for difference platforms have provided a global trading experience for users, yet such platforms still suffer from third party control issues that result in market censorship. What is required is a contract type that cannot be censored and can grant the retail trader the same global financial access in a low cost, secure and instant fashion. A permissionless perpetual swap contract that can be accessed by anybody with an internet connection fits this mold.\n\nA perpetual swap is a financial contract that grants exposure to any market for any amount of time. Utilising a perpetual swap, trader’s can very simply go long or short at their desired leverage ratio and gain the market exposure that fits their financial beliefs. The perpetual swap contract basically emulates the experience of holding an asset or going short an asset in spot markets.\n\nTracer’s open-source and accessible perpetual swap framework is a way for any application or user to gain exposure to any asset at anytime. The Tracer Perpetual Swap is an entirely permissionless protocol that appropriately aligns the incentives of liquidators, oracles, liquidity providers, insurers and traders. To date, perpetual swap contracts have been engineered with centralised elements and utilise risky liquidation and insurance mechanisms that rely on third parties. Tracer’s Perpetual Swap contracts change the game and provide a more secure and reliable option.\n\n![Perpetual Swaps](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/perp_swap_054a7d769c/perp_swap_054a7d769c.png)\n\nThe Tracer Perpetual Swap contract template has been engineered for traders to gain maximum exposure for minimum cost whilst experiencing the highest level of security guarantees. Anybody can permissionlessly deploy a new Perpetual Swap market with any quote and base assets. The base asset that clears and settles the agreement can be any ERC20 and the quote asset can be any derivative with an accessible price feed. If there is no price feed, then Tracer Governors or contract creators can utilise oracle financing techniques as a means of price feed discovery. Traders can either trade through a peer-to-peer order-matching mechanism or through on-chain Automated Market Maker contract (AMM). Each deployed market can have multiple AMMs with different pricing functions which have the same privileges as any other trader in the system. The first deployable AMM design is a novel delta-neutral Automated Market Maker (dnAMM) that has been engineered specifically for perpetual swaps.\n\nUnlike traditional futures or swap contracts that expire, a perpetual swap contract allows for users to hold their position in perpetuity. This perpetual nature is permitted by the funding rate. The funding rate is a small interest rate that is paid between counter-parties to balance demand for the derivative position. The funding rate as a mechanism also balances demand for the derivative contract ensuring that it tends towards the spot price for the underlying market. If the derivative position is trading at $110 and the spot market is trading at $100 this indicates a high demand for long exposure. Based on this $10 difference known as the premium, a fee would be paid from the long party to the short party to drive the price down. The opposite would be true if the derivative price was trading below spot price. In the Tracer Perpetual Swap contract, the funding rate mechanism is open to be optimised over-time by governance.\n\nEach Tracer Perpetual Swap market has an isolated insurance pool specific to that market allowing for liquidation risk to be localised, not putting the entire ecosystem at risk. Insurance pool depositors receive an ERC20 iToken in exchange for their deposits which are a tradable fungible claim to their insurance position. For example, if 100 USDC was deposited into a TSLA/USDC market, the insurer will receive an amount of iUSDC proportional to their share of the USDC in the insurance pool. To reclaim the 100 USDC, the insurer would burn their iUSDC. Insurers earn an Insurance Funding Rate for that is paid by traders that leverage their position. The more a trader is leveraged, the higher their insurance funding rate payments. The role of the insurer is to effectively underwrite liquidators, to ensure that they can profitably liquidate positions that are nearing bankruptcy.\n\n## Alpha Testers\nLion’s Mane will be collecting a list of alpha tester applications and presenting it to Tracer DAO. Lion’s Mane recommends to Tracer DAO Governors that 100 initial alpha testers are chosen by the existing DAO Governors and granted 25,000 governance rights (TCR tokens) each. If an applicant is successful and refers another successful applicant, an additional 2,500 governance rights should be granted to the referee.\n\n### Prospective Perpetual Swap Alpha Testers\n- Trader:\nSpeculators and hedgers that trade through the interface will help in providing feedback on the user experience.\n- Market Maker:\nPerpetual Swaps require market makers that will provide liquidity to the order-book as well as to the system AMM's.\n- Insurer:\nEach market needs insurers so that liquidators remain profitable. People that understand risk and how to analyse risk will make valuable insurers.\n- Liquidator:\nIn order for the system to remain collateralised and secure, liquidations must occur. Liquidators will run clients and profit from liquidations.\n- Oracle Expert:\nEach Perpetual Swap market requires an oracle for its funding rate, we are looking oracles and oracle experts that understand how to securely provide feeds for a contract.\n\nApply to be an alpha tester [here](https://tracer-finance.typeform.com/to/CLDvv8H7).\n\nIn the coming months alpha testers will be granted access to a Perpetual Swap frontend interface and asked to provide feedback on the protocol. Radical candour and honest feedback will be welcomed by the Lion’s Mane team who will be managing this process on behalf of Tracer DAO.\n\nStay up to date with the progression of the Tracer ecosystem here and be sure to join these community links\n\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/kvJEwfvyrW)\n- [Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO)","description":"Individuals around the world lack access to global stock, commodities and other asset markets for a number of reasons.

However, there is much to learn about Arbitrum before Tracer deploys, so we’ve compiled the following read to provide you with a greater understanding of the L2\\. The most common questions about Arbitrum observed in Discord, Discourse & Twitter have led us to curate a comprehensive FAQ. For a digestible technical summary of Arbitrum, make sure you’ve read [this](https://tracer.finance/radar/arbitrum-in-under-10/).\n\n**UPDATE:** Tracer [Perpetual Pools](https://pools.tracer.finance/) is now live on Arbitrum One\n\n## Does Arbitrum have a token?\n\nNo, there isn't a token. The initial ‘Arbitrum One’ chain will exclusively use Ether to pay for fees incurred during the operation of the protocol. However, it is important to note that additional Arbitrum chains can be launched in the future, and each chain can decide the token that it will use to pay for fees. This question has been asked many times in the Arbitrum (formerly Offchain Labs) Discord and of all the answers provided, two that seem to summarise the reason pretty well are:\n\n> “There is no token. This is Ethereum’s scaling solution and so all you need is Ether to use it~”  \n> (Rachel Franks | Offchain Labs, 03/07/2021)\n> \n> “We don't have a token. Our company is funded by venture capital investors.”  \n> (Ed Felten | Offchain Labs — 16/10/2020)\n\nThere have been multiple instances of fake Arbitrum tokens being sold as a scam, and the Arbitrum team have repeatedly stated that there are no plans to release a token in the future.\n\n## Why is there no contract size limit?\n\nIt's because of the way that the challenge protocol is designed. When one user challenges another user’s disputable assertion, they must play an interactive dissection game that is refereed by a layer 1 contract. Essentially two users will go back and forth, closing in on a single instruction that they disagree on. Only this instruction will be sent to the layer 1 contract to be re-executed, which will determine the winner of the challenge. This means that no matter how large the contract is, only one single instruction will need to be re-executed on layer 1 to resolve a dispute. So Arbitrum does not inherit Ethereum’s contract size limit.\n\n\n![Arbitrum does not inherit Ethereum’s contract size limit](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Arbitrum_FA_Qs_Infographics_1_a6fac0d60d/Tracer_Arbitrum_FA_Qs_Infographics_1_a6fac0d60d.png)\n\n> Arbitrum does not inherit Ethereum’s contract size limit\n\n## How long does it take to withdraw funds on Arbitrum?\n\nThird party “fast exit” withdrawal services (such as connext and hop-exchange) will effectively buy your withdrawal from you, for a price that is slightly less than the amount you are withdrawing. This means that for a fee you can receive your withdrawal instantly, while the fast exit service will receive the full amount once the withdrawal window has passed. The service is able to do this without any risk as they can run a node for themselves to determine that the withdrawal can’t be successfully challenged.\n\n## How does Arbitrum’s security compare to Ethereum?\n\nIt is the same. As all the data storage and execution occurs on layer 2, the Ethereum main chain is unaware of the details of each rollup block. However, the change in state that has resulted from a rollup block is reported back to layer 1\\. Also, Ethereum smart contracts are used to referee disputes that occur on layer 2\\. This, coupled with the fact that the result of every rollup block is reported to layer 1, is what allows Arbitrum to completely inherit Ethereum’s security. This further supports Tracer’s users in forming simple derivative agreements on the most secure and reliable infrastructure.\n\n## How much does Arbitrum reduce gas costs?\n\nThe reduction of gas costs is approximately a function of the layer 1 calldata, and thus the exact reduction will differ from project to project. As mainnet is currently live for developers—and will be live for users soon—some approximations are known. The Arbitrum website claims that certain projects are benefitting from 50x to 270x reduction of gas costs. With significantly reduced network costs, we’re estimating minimal fees for Tracer’s users when we deploy on Arbitrum.\n\n## What are Arbitrum’s fees charged for and how much are they?\n\nThe fees that are charged on Arbitrum are:\n\n*   Layer 1 calldata fee;\n*   layer 2 transaction base fee;\n*   layer 2 computation fee; and\n*   layer 2 storage fees.\n\nAll of the functions that determine how much these fees cost are in some way dependant on the layer 1 gas price. Arbitrum’s ArbOS doesn’t know the exact current layer 1 gas price, so it calculates a weighted average of recent gas prices paid by aggregators as an estimate. This estimate is used to calculate Arbitrum’s fees, which are collected by ArbOS, and are detailed below.\n\n**L2 transaction base fee:**  \nThis base fee is equal to the estimated layer 1 gas price, multiplied by the cost to submit an empty batch on layer 1, divided by the average batchSize - which is tracked by ArbOS. Or for clarity, (L1 gas) * (empty batch) / (batchSize).\n\n**L1 calldata fee:**  \nThis is simply the estimated layer 1 gas price.\n\n**Computation fees:**  \nThere is a minimum computation fee that will be charged for all executions. The exact price will increase above this minimum during periods of congestion. The minimum price is 1/10,000 the layer 1 gas price. The mechanism that adjusts the computation fee is largely inspired by EIP-1559\\. The price of computation will increase by a factor of the most recent price when demand is greater than supply, and will similarly decrease by a factor of the most recent price when supply is greater than demand, but never decrease below the minimum.\n\n**Storage fees:**  \nThe cost per allocated storage location on the EVM will be approximately 2000 x layer 1 gas price, which is 90% cheaper than layer 1.\n\n## How is the operation of the rollup impacted during a challenge period?\n\nFor the most part, there is no impact on the user. There are a few edge cases to clarify first, namely:\n\n*   Multiple disputes can occur at once.\n*   No user can be involved in multiple simultaneous disputes.\n*   The same assertion can be disputed multiple times.\n\nAlthough the protocol has to go through the dispute resolution process to decide the winner of the challenge, any validator can re-run the disputed assertion on layer 2 for themselves and find out who is guaranteed to win the challenge. This allows the validators to essentially preform a soft fork and continue on from the assertion that will eventually be confirmed. A dispute will slow down the withdrawal of funds from layer 2, but this can be sidestepped when the withdrawal involves a fungible token via the “fast exit” services mentioned above.\n\n![Arbitrum challenge period](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Arbitrum_FA_Qs_Infographic_2_1_07_846b6446e4/Tracer_Arbitrum_FA_Qs_Infographic_2_1_07_846b6446e4.png)\n\n> Although the protocol will take its time to determine the winner of the challenge, the validators can determine the winner instantly and effectively perform a soft fork while waiting for the protocol to catch up.\n\nTracer is excited to be deploying derivative contracts to Arbitrum mainnet in the coming months.

It exists in the digital realm as well as in our lives offline. There are vast capital markets and financial networks being built in the decentralised finance (DeFi) industry, which at present is a high-risk environment; and for builders and users who wish to sustain this environment and evolve its technology, intelligent risk management is essential.\n\nEnter Tracer; an open source, decentralised smart contract protocol for derivatives that enables reliable risk management.\n\nHistorically, derivatives tools and technologies have been the domain of financial institutions whose processes, protocols and systems are opaque and prohibitively expensive.\n\nTracer’s mission is to reimagine trust in the financial industry, by solving the extant problems attached to derivatives and their foundational technologies through its open-source, transparent protocol.\n\n## Transparency\n\nOne of the imperfections of the traditional financial system is that it relies on trusted third parties to facilitate transactions.\n\nTracer, on the other hand, is decentralised by design, allowing it to provide powerful levels of security through its open-source code and reliable blockchain infrastructure. This is a catalysing force for secure, self-determined and autonomous transacting between individuals, businesses and markets.\n\nThe inherent result of this transparency is accessibility. Tracer makes derivatives easy to engage with and understand. Simple terms, simple risk management. You can read the [whitepapers](https://tracer.finance/learn/) to familiarise yourself with the inner machinations of this technology and its praxis.\n\n## Barriers to Entry + Accessibility\n\nTracer’s barriers to entry stand at near zero. All you need is an internet connection.\n\nThe Tracer protocol operates as a novel architect for derivative markets. The smart contracts are permissionless, meaning anybody can deploy a new market, circumventing the traditionally exorbitant costs of market creation due to administrative fees, bureaucracy and the time investment; not to mention the requisite guaranteed participation of traders and hedgers in order for the market to function.\n\nThe only external input required by a Tracer contract to function as a market is a reliable data feed. Fortunately, a decentralised oracle network can source you this. Put simply, a decentralised oracle network gathers data from multiple operator nodes and uses a consensus mechanism to arrive at an aggregated, single source of truth for that data feed.\n\nIn addition, when these foundational derivative protocols are established, myriad applications and markets can be built as services on top — similar to how Apple and Android have cultivated rich development environments and ecosystems.\n\nTracer contracts can be integrated into incumbent software used by financial institutions as well as neo-banking applications that provide risk management tools.\n\n### The Tracer Factory:\n\nFinancial innovation is achieved through the Tracer Factory. This is a facility capable of mass-producing financial markets. For example, a financial contract type, such as the perpetual swap, can be added to the factory once engineered (the addition is voted on by Tracer DAO governors) and will exist as a template in the factory — able to be reproduced on demand.\n\nContract templates ensure standardisation, an advantage which is significant for traders and applications to be built on top of Tracer.\n\nAnybody can permissionlessly deploy a template installed in the factory, provided they have an oracle price feed to price it; and token to settle the agreement.\n\n## Risk Management & Security\n\nTracer can ensure an outstanding level of security that traditional financial infrastructure cannot provide.\n\nThe cryptographic technology underpinning Tracer allows it to preserve the sovereignty of the individual, the business and the market; and enable consumers to trade with trust through a decentralised and transparent process.\n\n### Tracer Factory Contracts:\n\nThe perpetual swap is a derivative contract that is an incredible risk management tool. It’s a financial contract that accords exposure to any market in perpetuity.\n\nTraditionally, these contracts have been engineered with centralised components and use liquidation and insurance mechanisms that are reliant on third party providers — a high risk practice. Tracer’s perpetual swap contracts provide a far more secure and reliable option.\n\nTracer’s Perpetual Pools contract is a new derivative primitive with no liquidations and no margins. The contract template has been configured for traders to gain maximum exposure at minimum cost, while guaranteeing the highest level of security. Anybody can permissionlessly deploy a new market with any quote and base assets.\n\nEach Tracer Perpetual Swaps market has an isolated insurance pool specific to that market, allowing for liquidation risk to be localised, neatly avoiding jeopardising the entire ecosystem.\n\n### Chainlink:\n\nThere are a variety of token risks that require management in the decentralised digital economy.\n\nTo demonstrate: take a prospective Chainlink stake and imagine that an entity purchased a LINK token to secure the Chainlink network. They may wish to stake this token for a fixed period of 6 months. By using Tracer derivatives for risk management, the entity can lock in their LINK stake, guaranteeing a fixed price over that 6-month period.\n\nChainlink node operators, one of the largest gas consumers in the DeFi economy, need to manage their gas risk, which is considerably volatile. Tracer is building a market for these operators so they can continue to reliably provide pricing data for the DeFi economy.\n\n![Fixed Prices](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/fixed_prices_89ce374b0c/fixed_prices_89ce374b0c.png)\n\n## Impacts and Opportunities for Markets\n\nThe Tracer protocol provides a bulwark against being held hostage by constituents of unpredictability, like fluctuating resource prices. It also allows the creation of new, experimental markets at very low cost.\n\n### Agriculture:\n\nThe futures and insurance markets for agricultural commodities have enabled farmers to scale their operations and feed the world. Many parts of the world don’t have an existing market, making access to these products challenging.\n\nTracer infrastructure will support these new markets and deliver risk management tools directly to a farmer’s smartphone, no matter where they are in the world.\n\n### Climate + Environment:\n\nCarbon credit generating companies produce and sell their carbon to other entities that purchase these credits to operate as carbon neutral. These companies require risk management tools so that they can remain carbon neutral at a fixed cost.\n\nMany of these real-world market prices and values will eventually be crypto-economically secured by Chainlink oracles, serving as a reliable, definitive truth for Tracer contracts to consume and pay out each counter-party.\n\n### Natural Resources:\n\nTracer aims to forge new water derivative markets that allow astute management of one of our most essential natural resources. It’s imperative that sophisticated markets for water exist, so the resource can be effectively shared and priced in the economy.\n\n![New market creation](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/water_fuel_markets_22a2495216/water_fuel_markets_22a2495216.png)\n\n### Individual consumers:\n\nTracer envisions a world where individuals are easily able to manage their local consumption risk.\n\nFor instance, an Uber driver’s profits are dependent on how much they spend on fuel. They can minimise their fuel pricing risk by locking in a fixed price via Tracer derivatives. The purchase process of this contract can be completely abstracted and easily baked into a user-friendly interface for any driver.\n\n## Trust You Can See\n\nBy creating definitive truth through crypto-economic guarantees, many new local and global markets can be formed via Tracer, which meaningfully enable both individuals and firms to manage their risk.\n\nThe Tracer protocol is the vanguard answer to the systemic problem of mistrust in traditional financial firms; and is a potent solution against the stranglehold that these financial institutions have over consumers.\n\nTracer allows users to ‘trace’ any digital or real-world market with an oracle and form simple derivative agreements — the contracts are built and owned by the user, for the user. It’s transparent, secure and decentralised; it is trust you can see.\n\n## Get Involved\n\nWe’re currently growing and expanding.

It is clear that data relationships will play an important role for many of the DeFi protocols looking to create meaningful products that extend beyond crypto price feeds.\n\nIn the Information Age, data wars have been fought on many different battlefields. In this edition of Data Wars, we will discuss the upcoming financial data wars to be fought by oracle providers, traditional financial firms and financial smart contract protocols, such as Tracer.\n\nWithin the DeFi economy there will be two sources of data that exist for derivative contracts. In both instances, data inputs are a cost for that contract that will inevitably have to be paid for in fees by the derivative user:\n\n1.  Off-chain proprietary data relayed by oracles such as Chainlink; and\n2.  On-chain exchange contracts or meta-oracle contracts that source pricing data from a variety of different on-chain contracts.\n\nThe traditional centralised market for derivative pricing data is gigantic. Each day at different frequencies and times around the world, derivative contracts are marked to market using pricing data delivered by proprietary firms who have curated their feeds to be unbiased and reliable.\n\nTo grasp the sheer size of this pricing data market, [CME’s financial reports](https://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2021/2/10/cme_group_inc_reportsfourth-quarterandfull-year2020financialresu.html) that determine $545.4M in revenue (of $3.85B total) stems from data services. To zoom a bit further out, the traditional financial market data industry is said to be valued in the range of $33B, and [growing](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/global-spend-on-financial-market-data-totals-a-record-33-2-billion-in-2020--rising-5-9-on-demand-for-pricing-reference-and-portfolio-management-data---new-burton-taylor-report-301264995.html).\n\nThe on-chain market for pricing data is only just beginning. Protocols such as Uniswap - which harbour large portions of spot exchange volume - are now able to provide reliable pricing data that can be used to price other ecosystem derivative contracts that can read directly from the on-chain uniswap contract. Due to this emerging model, discussions have led to propositions that [UNI should be an oracle token](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/uni-should-become-an-oracle-token/11988).\n\nA derivative protocol such as Tracer needs to consume these oracle price feeds to provide secure and reliable markets for end consumers. The following article will touch on two property rights models:\n\n1.  Exchange owned data; and\n2.  User Owned data.\n\nWe will discuss the implications these data wars may have for a data consuming protocol such as Tracer.\n\n## Exchange Owned Data\n\nConsortium Oracle Networks are a likely eventuality in the next 2 year timeframe within DeFi. Centralised exchanges that are seeking additional revenue through data licensing are likely to form agreements with different oracles that form a Chainlink DONs. Such firms will most likely be instantiating master-agreements with cohorts of Chainlink oracles that deal with licensing and data sale. These consortium oracle networks will form around traditional financial exchanges that sell their pricing data as a product, such as the CME, NYSE and the ASX.\n\n![Off-Chain to On-Chain Data](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/data_wars_graphic_1_4a3a2d4039/data_wars_graphic_1_4a3a2d4039.png)\n\nTraditional financial firms such as the CME have proprietary data relating to the derivatives and products traded on their platform. Oracle providers brokering relationships with firms to re-sell their data for the pricing of DeFi derivative contracts will introduce a new revenue stream for such firms. Within this model, it is likely that relationships will be formed between trusted protocols that pay the appropriate fees and have been able to license their contracts (whether that be through AML/KYC networks or by other means).\n\nCurrent hurdles around AML/KYC and the reselling of data are still to be solved. These hurdles are preventing a lot of current pricing data from finding its way onto DeFi contracts. Another cause of this issue is that the majority of demand within DeFi is for higher-returning crypto assets, due to the average DeFi user’s risk tolerance.\n\nThere are clear economic incentives within DeFi when it is compared to traditional financial markets. Higher yields and lower transaction costs are just some of those advantages. As these advantages become clearer to traditional traders, it is inevitable that equities, commodities and forex markets will be traded using DeFi infrastructure.\n\nFor a data consuming protocol such as Tracer, most on-chain oracle feeds have yet to fully determine their pricing and licencing model due to the nascence of the industry. Currently, any protocol can basically gain access to on-chain price feeds for free, without paying the feed provider. Future models will introduce ZKPs for data values and whitelisted read addresses that are either:\n\n*   Paying customers; or\n*   A combination of paying and licensed customers.\n\nWith respect to data that natively exists on-chain, such as a Uniswap oracle, exchanges now have a choice between the smart contracts owning the data, or the user having rights to the data that they have created.\n\nIn the next part of this article we will discuss a new model where the user owns their data inputs and has rights to the revenue stream that is generated from it.\n\n## User-Owned Data\n\nIn this reality, the user that contributes volume towards a TWAP value, or whatever form of aggregated data value, has an economic claim to any revenue that is generated from that price. This is somewhat of a brave new world that we’d love to see spot exchanges adopt and consider in more detail.\n\n![User Owned Data](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/data_wars_graphic_2_6035f2db15/data_wars_graphic_2_6035f2db15.png)\n\nIn this model, a Sushiswap user that has contributed 28% of volume towards an ETH/DAI market would have rights to 28% of any revenue derived from ETH/DAI oracle-paying customers. This would be dependent on how the price had been aggregated for a given period of time. Should any Tracer contract be a consumer of the Sushi oracles, the fees paid by Tracer contracts would be sent to a distribution contract within the Sushi protocol and dispersed to users from there.\n\nThe protocol then simply acts as a vector for exchange. It’s revenue model is in taking exchange fees. On-chain meta-oracles that source pricing data from many on-chain sources will be able to exist on top of these contract layers and provide effective aggregation services for potential DeFi consumer contracts.\n\nRegulatory arbitrage likely exists for protocols that are not willing to take protocol fees, who can then profit from the oracle data sales instead - creating ambiguity as to the exact economic mode that the user is buying into. For retail customers, usually this financial revenue that is generated from the sale of their data is completely abstracted from their trading experience in the form of zero fees or costs to using the exchange.\n\nWhere things become interesting is when a tokenomic incentive for data sales is introduced. In exchange-owned models, you can earn a share of the future revenues generated from the sale of any of your data rights that you had sold to the protocol. This model compensates the user more than current centralised exchange models or even social media platforms.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nTo conclude, there will be a variety of ways that oracle data is sourced and derived on-chain. Many different business models will be formed around them to successfully extract value at the transaction layer.\n\nIn this article we have discussed how traditional financial data may be ported on-chain through Consortium Oracle Networks, as well as how users may be able to own their own pricing data and be paid for their contributions.\n\nIt is foreseeable that with the progression of technologies such as Ethereum, Chainlink & ZKPs each financial exchange user can be their own oracle, and own their transaction data, having right to its sale. All of us within the DeFi community are in a unique position to ensure that we don’t permit data exploitation, which played such a prominent part in traditional finance over the past 20 years. Tracer as a DeFi protocol will continue to deeply consider the data rights of its users, and will make sure that our future users are compensated for their data contributions.\n\nIn future editions of Data Wars we’ll cover many new topics, including tomorrow’s data that will be worth trading, which will be more focused on environmental data, social data, unique index data and sentiment data.\n\nCheck in here regularly for more thought pieces and announcements, hang out with us in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kvJEwfvyrW) and get updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO).\n\n_This thought piece is authored by [Pat McNab](https://twitter.com/pat_mcnab), co-founder of Mycelium._","description":"For DeFi spectators and commentators, a clear future is emerging; DeFi derivatives will consume and replace any market that has an oracle price feed.

For the full audit completed by Sigma Prime, see [here](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTGAU4mF4P9TFPjSBw5gwUydzF3XX1BfRdX68RnsYjvDs). The Perpetual Pools codebase is now fully open-sourced and can be found [here](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts).\n\nProtocol security – the safety of users' funds primarily – is our biggest priority. As such we want to provide some insight into the audit results, as well as giving the community a more candid insight into perpetual pools.\n\nThere were a total of 12 issues raised, with 1 critical, 1 medium, 2 lows and 8 informational issues. The team has already actioned all of the above-mentioned issues in the form of fixes or mitigation strategies and is excited to be bringing Tracer Perpetual Pools to market.\n\nThe following is a summary of all issues, their severity, and the corresponding fix if applicable.\n\n## TCR-01 Denial-of-Service Attack on Leveraged Pool via Multiple Commits\n\nSeverity: Critical\n\nStatus: Mitigated\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/147](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/147)\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/162](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/162)\n\nThis issue has been raised as a critical by the Sigma Prime team because if abused, it has the potential to deadlock a pool and prevent users from interacting with the protocol.\n\nWhile the team was aware of this issue, finding a suitable mitigation strategy proved difficult. Ultimately we ended up opting for the simple approach of having a minimum commit size and maximum commit queue size. This allows us to compute the cost of attack for each and every pool.\n\nThe current mitigation strategy for this issue is to introduce the following two parameters to the Tracer Pools\n\n*   `minimumCommitSize` : The minimum size measured in settlement tokens, that a user must commit to mint or burn\n*   `maximumCommitQueueLength` : The maximum number of commits that may be pending for any given period.\n\nThe combination of the above two parameters can be fine tuned to increase the economic cost of performing a denial of service attack. It should also be noted that gas fees are a factor in this equation since each individual commit a user makes will cost them gas.\n\nThese parameters will be fine tuned by the developer multisig initially, and then once the protocol has been operating smoothly, this responsibility will be passed on to the DAO.\n\nWhile fine tuning these parameters, consideration must be made of the gas block limit and computational ArbGas limit (when operating on Arbitrum).\n\nThe team has also removed the `uncommit` functionality, meaning that for users to perform an attack they must actually commit funds to the protocol and mint pool tokens, hence providing liquidity themselves.\n\n## TCR-02 User Can Reset earliestCommitUnexecuted State Variable\n\nSeverity: Medium\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/140](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/140).\n\nThis issue was raised as a medium due to the fact that a user could manipulate the `earliestCommitUnexecuted` state variable, given they had enough commits in a particular order. This issue did not have the potential to steal user funds or cause issues with minting and burning and has been patched in the following PR [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/140](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/140).\n\n## TCR-03 Invalid string to bytes16 Conversion\n\nSeverity: Low\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/151](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/151)\n\n## TCR-04 Divide Before Multiply\n\nSeverity: Low\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/161](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/161)\n\n## TCR-05 Ownable Oracle Allowed in ChainlinkOracleWrapper\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Acknowledged\n\nFix: N/A\n\nThe Mycelium team acknowledges that this issue is currently present. However, due to the security model of the V1 launch, it is not being patched and is instead considered part of our current model. Deploying trustless oracles is a difficult problem to solve. While the protocol utilises Chainlink oracles, we still need to ensure that these oracles can easily be updated should Chainlink feeds change.\n\nEach Chainlink Oracle Wrapper will be deployed by the developer multisig, with control handed over to the DAO after the initial launch period. By having each oracle wrapper controlled by either the multisig or the DAO means that in order for the mentioned exploit to be executed, the DAO or multisig would have to be malicious and initiate a proposal to change the oracle being used.\n\nProposals take 2 days to warm up when sent via the DAO and as such any user in a pool that experiences this attack from the DAO will be able to get notified and exit the pool.\n\n## TCR-06 Unnecessary Multiplication by fixedPoint\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/160](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/160)\n\nThis issue was raised as an informational. Primarily due to the fact that it did not cause any problems within the protocol. This is due to how the power leverage formula works to compute the amount of funds to move between each side of the pool. It is based on a ratio, and as both the numerator and denominator were being multiplied, the ratio was still consistent. It did however add unnecessary gas usage to the protocol, and this has been fixed.\n\nThe community will be updated as soon as the team moves away from the multisig ownership model to complete DAO ownership.\n\n## TCR-07 Potential MEV Attack When Users Commit\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Mitigated\n\nFix: N/A\n\nThis threat still exists in the current model. While the team feels this attack is quite unlikely, it is possible for a malicious actor to use a MEV service such as flashbots and bribe a miner to manipulate the block timestamp to ensure they are the last user entering the pool.\n\nTo mitigate against this, the front running interval is being set to 5 minutes for each pool deployed. This prevents users from performing this exploit on last minute price updates, as nobody can enter any later than 5 minutes before a price update. The team believes this alone is enough to almost entirely remove any MEV that can be gained using a similar attack to that mentioned in the audit report.\n\n## TCR-08 onlyGov Role Can Withdraw Users’ Fund\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Mitigated\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/144](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/144).\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/141](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/141)\n\nThis issue was raised as an informational. This issue is acknowledged by the team and still exists in the codebase. As mentioned in TCR-05 this issue is mitigated by having the onlyGov role initially be a dev multisig, and then the Tracer DAO. Once control is transferred to the DAO, any action it takes must propagate through the proposal system, meaning users would have two days to act before any of the raised issues could be exploited.\n\nWe have also introduced an explicit pause and withdraw function that allows the onlyGov to more explicitly drain user funds. This has been introduced as a safety measure to the protocol, to allow pools to be paused if need be, and to allow user funds to be returned should an exploit occur. The changes that introduce this pause and withdraw functionality can be found in the following two PRs:\n\nWithdraw Functionality: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/144](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/144)\n\nPause Functionality: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/141](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/141)\n\n## TCR-09 Known Issues\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Fixed / Mitigated\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/156.](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/156)\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/154](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/154).\n\nThis raised 4 separate issues that were known to the team. They were:\n\n*   multistep governance transfer;\n*   view function for keeper rewards;\n*   keeper gas price usage; and\n*   new keeper propagation.\n\n### Multistep Governance Transfers\n\nThis issue has been addressed in the following PR [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/156](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/156)\n\n### View Function for Keeper Rewards\n\nWhile a function does exist that allows keepers to compute their tip amount (see `PoolKeeper.keeperReward`), it is difficult to extract this out into a simple view function for any keeper to call. This is due to the fact that there are a number of factors that go into computing the final reward. It is recommended that keepers use this function along with their own data to estimate the reward for each call. This is however outside of the protocol scope.\n\n### Keeper Gas Price Usage\n\nThis issue has been addressed in the following PR [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/154](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/154). Once more reliable gas price oracles exist, the team will be looking to migrate over to a more dynamic solution.\n\n### New Keeper Propagation\n\nThis issue has not been addressed. For the initial release, the dev multisig and Tracer DAO will be responsible for deploying markets. Any updates that need to happen to the Keeper Contract will be batch propagated by the party performing the upgrade. This keeps this functionality out of the core protocol.\n\n## TCR-10 Test Coverage Improvements\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Acknowledged\n\nFix: N/A\n\nThe test suite is actively being improved by the team. The tests produced by Sigma Prime are also being integrated into the Perpetual Pools test suite.\n\n## TCR-11 Gas Optimisations\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\nFix: [https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/157](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/157).\n\nAll gas optimisations have been implemented.\n\n## TCR-12 Miscellaneous Tracer Contract Issues\n\nSeverity: Informational\n\nStatus: Fixed\n\nFix:\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/158](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/158)\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/147](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/147)\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/162](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/162)\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/147](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/147)\n\n[https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/162](https://github.com/mycelium-ethereum/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/162)\n\nAll miscellaneous fixes have been implemented.","description":"Tracer DAO has recently wrapped up an audit with Sigma Prime on the Tracer Perpetual Pools smart contracts.

Just as the demand for push notifications has become prominent in the traditional sense, there is a growing need for these notifications within the decentralised ecosystem.\n\nEthereum Push Notification Service (**EPNS)** is a protocol for blockchain-based notifications that is both platform agnostic and incentivised. EPNS initially [proposed an integration](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/tracer-to-implement-epns-decentralized-notifications/256) with Tracer DAO on 1 June 2021 for governance, product and community based notifications. Tracer DAO will be looking to integrate a number of notifications under these categories, the first being 'governance'.\n\nThe key to distributed decision-making through a DAO is operational efficiency. This is achieved through clear communication and proactive contributors. Tracer DAO welcomes innovative tools to support the democratic decision-making required to power the financial infrastructure of the future and is pleased to announce EPNS as a Service Provider to help achieve this. Historically, participation in network governance has been hindered by fragmented discussion in voting channels. Instant notifications for governors will maintain active participance in Tracer DAO and ensure proposals are voted on and discussed in a timely manner. At a high level, Tracer DAO will leverage EPNS for a variety of use-cases:\n\n1.  Notify Tracer DAO governors/community members when a new proposal is uploaded to Snapshot;\n2.  Notify Tracer DAO governors/community members when a Snapshot proposal has passed; and\n3.  Notify Tracer DAO governors/community members when a proposal has been implemented and passed on-chain.\n\nThe implementation of EPNS in Tracer DAO's ecosystem will establish a direct channel from governance activity to governors. All notifications are sent directly to the wallets of governors, where immediate action is taken.\n\n![EPNS frontend](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/epns_app_1c2e675d3c/epns_app_1c2e675d3c.gif)\n\n\"By leveraging EPNS, Tracer DAO members will be able to remain active in governing the protocol - ensuring that they do not miss a beat. Tracer DAO’s vision of democratic decision-making that supports the evolution of the next financial system will greatly benefit from EPNS technology.\" [Patrick McNab](https://twitter.com/pat_mcnab), a contributor of Tracer DAO.\n\nIn the near future, EPNS will provide value beyond the governance of Tracer DAO. For instance, users of Tracer's Perpetual Swaps can be pushed with notifications such as market order status and margin accounts nearing liquidation. Additionally, members of the community will be notified for upcoming community calls and events. Moreover, Tracer DAO plans to adapt the highly customisable EPNS protocol features to meet the various push notification needs of Tracer's future products.\n\nTracer DAO welcomes this innovative integration and will continue to create more streamlined processes for governors, community members and users alike. More information on the EPNS integration can be found on [Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/) soon.\n\nYou can follow EPNS on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/epnsproject) or visit their [site](https://epns.io/).\n\nCheck in here regularly for more thought pieces and announcements, hang out with us in the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kvJEwfvyrW) and get updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO).","description":"In today's age, push notifications have become an incredibly powerful tool for businesses and applications.

The initial integration will include the use of Chainlink Oracles to support Tracer DAO’s derivatives contracts on Arbitrum.\n\nChainlink’s high-quality, tamper-proof price oracles are critical to securing several on-chain functions, most notably:\n\n*   maintenance of margin;\n*   verification of liquidations;\n*   and calculation of funding rates.\n\nBecause Tracer markets feature risk-free liquidations, the contracts need more than just the index price; they also need the current fast gas price and the price of ETH in USD (or whatever the market settles in). These liquidations leave traders with more equity and ensure that liquidators make money, representing a win-win scenario.\n\nChainlink Price Feeds not only strengthen the precision and robustness of Tracer’s derivatives markets, but they have a proven track record of delivering reliable price updates on-chain despite flash crash outliers, API downtime, and oracle manipulation attacks. Combining Chainlink’s time-tested reliability and wide collection of Price Feeds across many asset classes, the creation of derivatives markets for any provided data feed just became a thrilling possibility for DeFi users.\n\n## Tracer Unlocks Digital and Real World Markets with Chainlink Oracles\n\nTracer allows users to ‘trace’ any digital or real-world market with an oracle and form simple derivative agreements. By porting existing price data on-chain and creating definitive truth through crypto-economic guarantees, many new local and global markets can be formed that meaningfully enable both individuals and firms to manage their risk. Rather than being at the mercy of fluctuating fuel prices, consumers can now lock in their fuel price with an easy-to-use derivative contract. With quick, zero-permission deployment for perpetual swaps, Tracer can capture markets as soon as there is a trusted price oracle.\n\nTracer DAO is acutely aware of the importance of having accurate, up-to-date, and manipulation-resistant off-chain data being fed to on-chain contracts. Market creators should not trust trader funds with any subpar price feeds. With Chainlink Price Feeds already securing tens of billions of dollars of value across DeFi, it makes for the obvious oracle solution for Tracer DAO, showcasing our firm commitment to providing users with best-of-class data.\n\n![Tracer's Integration with Chainlink.](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/chainlink_diagram_64f73563ad/chainlink_diagram_64f73563ad.png)\n\nSome of the major benefits of Chainlinking Tracer’s derivatives markets include:\n\n*   **High-quality Data** — Chainlink Price Feeds source data from numerous premium data aggregators, leading to price  \n    data that’s aggregated from hundreds of exchanges, weighted by volume, and cleaned from outliers and wash trading.\n\n*   **Secure Node Operators** — Chainlink Price Feeds are secured by independent, security-reviewed, and Sybil-resistant  \n    oracle nodes run by leading blockchain DevOps teams, data providers, and traditional enterprises. Chainlink nodes have  \n    a strong track record for reliability, even during high gas prices and extreme network congestion.\n\n*   **Decentralized Network** — Chainlink Price Feeds are decentralized at the data source, oracle node, and oracle network levels, generating strong protections against downtime and tampering by either the data provider or the oracle network.\n\n*   **Reputation** — Chainlink provides a robust reputation framework and set of on-chain monitoring tools such as [Chainlink Oracle Reputation](https://reputation.link) that allow users to independently verify the historical performance of node operators and oracle networks, as well as check the real-time prices being offered.\n\nThe integration of Chainlink oracles with Tracer will enable new derivative markets to be pioneered and unlocked by anybody with an internet connection. As market demand reaches a point where the price of data is cheap enough to warrant a derivative agreement, Tracer will utilize Chainlink to source and deliver this data on-chain to open up new and exciting derivatives markets. By working together to develop feeds, “Chainlink will help Tracer unlock markets that enable people to manage their everyday financial risk…” says Mycelium Co-Founder Patrick McNab, “…Chainlink is unrivalled in its offering of reliable and exotic data feeds, and Tracer is eager to scale alongside support from its oracle services.”\n\nThe ETH/USD perpetual swaps are set to drop on the Arbitrum mainnet in the coming months.\n\n## About Chainlink\n\nChainlink is the industry standard oracle network for powering hybrid smart contracts. Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks provide developers with the largest collection of high-quality data sources and secure off-chain computations to expand the capabilities of smart contracts on any blockchain.

Currently, the notional value of derivatives in traditional finance is four times the world’s debt[1] and sixteen times the world’s estimated money supply. How is this so? We’ll take a closer look throughout this education series, starting here at derivatives and the size of this market, and working through topics such as perpetual swaps, options, and what the future of the derivative market really could be.\n\nIn 2019 the global derivatives market represented $640T in notional value[2]. The size and scope of this market is staggering. While these figures may seem impossible, it's due to a concept called *leverage* that this large volume can exist. More importantly, the potential for monumental impact in the near future warrants the need for reliable risk management systems. \n\nWith leverage, the *notional value* is the amount the derivatives contract controls, or, the total underlying amount of a derivatives trade. Because of this, the *notional value* of derivative contracts is much higher than the *market value.* \n\nFirst things first, let’s examine the basics. Derivatives are contracts based on the value of an underlying asset such as currency or interest rates. Derivatives can be thought of as essential synthetic oil in the economic engine, a crucial element that commands significant sway over the rates we pay for goods and services. And yet, the market is rarely seen or heard of by those outside trading floors. Forwards and futures, options, and swaps are the three types of derivatives. Swaps, which are soon coming to the Tracer DAO ecosystem, allow for the exchange of cash flows between two parties and usually involve the exchange of a fixed cash flow for a floating cash flow.\n\n\n![Tracer_DerivativeEducation_Infographics_update_13-13.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Derivative_Education_Infographics_update_13_13_724d847be9/Tracer_Derivative_Education_Infographics_update_13_13_724d847be9.png)\n\n\n## Derivative Examples\n\nUnsurprisingly, derivatives exert a notable impact on modern finance by providing some advantages to the financial markets. They provide a way to lock in prices, hedge against unfavourable movements in rates, and mitigate risks, often at a limited cost. In addition, derivatives can often be purchased on margin — that is, with borrowed funds — which makes them even less expensive. They also enable organizations to gain access to otherwise unavailable assets or markets — for example, by employing interest rate swaps, a company may obtain a more favourable interest rate relative to the interest rates available from direct borrowing.\n\n\n## Derivative Trading\n\nWhen we look at current *estimations* of the global derivatives market, the *notional value*[3] is sitting around ~640T$USD. Whilst it is difficult to quantify the exact figure, it is clear that the value of these trading instruments *(or at least the total value these instruments control)*, are an order of magnitude larger than its underlying market. Previously, this may cause one to err on the side of caution. After all, it was the credit default swap that caused the global financial crisis. However, with new technologies there is the potential for safer, transparent, risk mitigation systems to prevent these events reoccurring.\n\n\n![Tracer_DerivativeEducation_Infographics_update_02-01.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Derivative_Education_Infographics_update_02_01_3e0706da84/Tracer_Derivative_Education_Infographics_update_02_01_3e0706da84.png)\n> While **Debt**, **Market Cap** and **Notional Value** are different metrics of value, these images depict quantitative measurements of financial markets in FIAT denomination. \n\n\nCurrently, the everyday retail trader (regardless of experience) has little to no access to this market. The privilege of this access has only been bestowed upon corporate institutions and hedge funds. The growing decentralised derivatives market highlights the retail investor appetite for this untapped market, utilizing the added benefits of decentralised technology, using a transparent, open source environment. \n\n\n### Derivative Contracts on the Blockchain\n\nThis decentralised derivatives market is an untapped goldmine, waiting to be discovered. With enormous potential for risk mitigation strategies and protection against price fluctuation. And, with DeFi continuing to challenge the dominance of traditional finance, it's only a matter of time before we see a decentralised derivative protocol such as Tracer DAO emerge as the next generation of financial infrastructure.\n\nTo assist this expansion, blockchain networks like Ethereum are allowing for new financial infrastructure, such as derivative protocols, to be built. With the help of smart contracts, this infrastructure provides extremely efficient and secure peer-to-peer transactions and agreements that are redefining the global financial landscape. As the power of smart contracts and blockchain continues to be realised by mainstream institutions, consumers will continue to shift their preferences from traditional fintech and to blockchain-powered technologies.\n\nAs reliable data becomes significantly more accessible on-chain, courtesy of projects like [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), the potential for new and exotic derivatives markets is opening up. Tracer aims to utilise these oracle data feeds to allow retail traders to take both long and short positions on any asset with a publicly available price feed. Tracer is bringing previously uncontemplated and inaccessible markets to anyone with an internet connection; allowing more people to gain access to risk mitigation strategies for unpredictable everyday events. \n\nTo keep updated and discuss all things derivatives and Tracer DAO, follow along on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tracerDAO), join the [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/kvJEwfvyrW), and check out governance on [Discourse](https://discourse.tracer.finance/).\n\n\n[1][https://fortune.com/2018/04/18/what-is-the-world-debt/](https://fortune.com/2018/04/18/what-is-the-world-debt/)\n[2][https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1912j.htm](https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt1912j.htm)\n[3][https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052715/how-big-derivatives-market.asp)\n[4][https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/](https://siblisresearch.com/data/us-stock-market-value/)\n[5][https://8marketcap.com/](https://8marketcap.com/)\n[6][https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories)\n\n","description":"The Derivatives Market will be disrupted and decentralised, providing immense potential for markets and risk applications.

Tracer's core derivative infrastructure will support structured products that will provide meaningful ways to manage and take risk in the DeFi economy. This successful capital raise marks a landmark moment in DAO-centric capital raising”.\n\nIn light of the capital raise, we will be introducing new developers into the team to bring future financial contracts to the Tracer ecosystem. Additionally, innovative Service Providers will be engaged by Tracer DAO to deliver on the vision of peer-to-peer finance.\n\nMariano Conti, Maker Mafia, believes “Tracer is one of the most interesting projects I've seen, not just in the perpetuals space, but overall. Their approach to governance is purely decentralised and novel. They've been quietly building for a while, but now I expect the market to know Tracer very well in the coming 12 months”.\n\nThe Tracer community plans to hold a Gnosis Auction in the coming months, with the goal of raising additional capital to further grow Tracer. Gnosis Auction is a platform for conducting fair, transparent, and decentralised token price discovery. The auction will be open to all, and those interested in participating can stay updated via Tracer’s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO).\n\nAlongside support from our new partners, Tracer is set to define the future of financial infrastructure.

The primary aim of the audit is to locate bugs, exploits and security concerns throughout the protocol code. Lion’s Mane has generously put together $80,000 USDC for the bounty award pool. The contest will run from 24/06/2021 12am UTC until 01/07/2021 12am UTC.\n\nCode 423n4 is a new, community-driven organisation that has devised a novel way of performing the crucial service of auditing smart contract code. Code 423n4 reviews code with a competitive, crowd-sourced process where all participants “eat what they kill”, as they compete to be the champion of the arena. In addition to the earlier audit performed by Sigma Prime, this second audit accords with Tracer’s vision of deploying impenetrable smart contracts.\n\nBy throwing the duty of auditing smart contract code to the community, Code 423n4 allows any skillful developer to gain rewards for their services. It is completely time flexible, with participants free to start and end their reviews whenever they choose. It also allows for specialisation, with the goal for each participant to not find all the bugs, but the bugs they want to find. Highly specialised security researchers stand to earn lucrative rewards for finding rare, high-risk bugs.\n\nThis new method of crowd-sourcing developer talent to perform auditing services is extremely powerful. Not only is it an antidote to the inefficiencies of engaging a traditional auditing firm, but it allows unknown talent to gain recognition, perhaps for the first time. The clever incentive structure helps drive creativity, diligence, effort, and quality. The chance to earn relative to your skill and effort means more interest and creativity from security auditors.\n\nTracer urges all interested developers to join in on the bounty. $80,000 USDC is up for grabs.

If you are familiar with LETFs, then you would know they suffer from a phenomenon named _Volatility Decay_. Perpetual Pools v1 is no different. Volatility decay, put simply, is the decay in a traders PnL (profit and loss) due to frequent directional change in the price of the underlying asset. While Perpetual Pools suffer from this, simulations suggest that their returns more closely track naive expectations of leverage than LETFs. That being said, we suggest traders use these instruments only for short term directional bets rather than hold them.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe [Tracer: Perpetual Pools Litepaper](https://tracer.finance/media/white-papers/perp-pools/perpetual-pools.pdf) outlines a simple derivative design to create leveraged tokens, in which long and short users have changing claims on a pool of collateral. In this design, the proportion of collateral that each party can claim changes based on a leveraged function of the underlying asset. This means that shares of the pool, which are tokenised, are leveraged. While a two-sided pool is the simplest way to gain leveraged exposure, and can't be liquidated like a perpetual swap, it comes with a downside – volatility decay.\n\n## What is Volatility Decay?\n\nVolatility decay, put simply, is the decay in a traders PnL (profit and loss) due to frequent directional change in the price of the underlying asset. It's the difference between the _naive expectation_ for leveraged returns and the _actual return_ of rebalanced leverage products like LETFs, leveraged tokens (FTX, Binance, ETH2x-FLI) and Perpetual Pools. **The instruments mentioned are designed for short term directional bets as the returns are path-dependent. They should not be held long term.** This article will break down why volatility decay occurs and how it relates to Perpetual Pools v1.\n\nThe following graph shows the decay of a Perpetual Pool long trader's PnL at a power leverage of 2, as the trader experiences sideways volatility. If this graph makes sense to you, then that's all you need to know. If it doesn't, read on below.\n\n![Volatility Decay Price_Movement](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/volatility_decay_graph_46c38056de/volatility_decay_graph_46c38056de.png)\n\n## Effective Leverage\n\nLETFs are a simple example of a rebalanced leverage product. These funds track an index that targets a specific leverage at the end of each trading day. You'll get a better grasp on this if you can understand the distinction between _leverage_ and _effective leverage_. Let's compare LETFs and perpetual swaps to make this distinction. The chart below shows the effective leverage of a 2x perpetual swap long position\n\n![Volatility Decay Graph](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/volatility_decay_slope_1ba57c3ee5/volatility_decay_slope_1ba57c3ee5.png)\n\nThe effective leverage on a perpetual swap varies with the price of the underlying. As the price goes up, the value of your long position increases. When this happens, your position's profit pays back some of the amount you borrowed to open the position. Because the leverage multiplier is based on your initial opening price, as the value of the portfolio grows, your leverage shrinks. If you wanted to maintain a certain leverage multiplier with a perpetual swap, it would require constant rebalancing. That means adding and removing margin to maintain your debt to equity ratio. This is where Perpetual Pools and LETFs are advantageous.\n\n![Volatility Decay Graph 2](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/volatility_decay_2_3558589113/volatility_decay_2_3558589113.png)\n\nLETFs rebalance at the end of each trading day. They rebalance to target the same leverage by reinvesting profits back into the position as margin. If the position loses money during the day, they will decrease their overall debt. The effective leverage curve of an LETF is, thus, constant: it's the flat line in the image above. Take an example where the price goes up on consecutive days. An LETF will profit more than a perpetual swap as daily profits are reinvested back into the position (a side note: profits are reinvested as margin to support more borrowings). This is the act of rebalancing. But rebalancing also means that the position stands to lose more when price goes down. Consider the example where price goes from 100→101→100→101:\n\n![Volatility Decay Graph 3](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/volatility_decay_3_d07eb9751b/volatility_decay_3_d07eb9751b.png)\n\n> Image 4: In this table, the pnl columns represent cumulative PnL for both perpetual Swaps and LETFs.\n\nThere's a difference between the LETF's return and the perpetual swap's return. This difference is what we call volatility decay: the price moved sideways (it was volatile) and, though the underlying returned to the same starting price, the act of rebalancing manifests as a decay in the performance of the LETF. At time 3, the perpetual swap's returns are 0.02% greater than that of the LETF. LETFs, and similar rebalancing assets, are made for short term, unidirectional trades as there will be decay every time there's a price reversion.\n\n## Perpetual Pools Performance\n\nWe can also compare the volatility decay of LETFs to Perpetual Pools v1\\. First, assume that LETF performance follows from this equation derived in [Zhang 2010](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~avellane/thesis_Zhang.pdf):\n\n![Volatility Decay Equation](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/volatility_decay_math_7afe04dc67/volatility_decay_math_7afe04dc67.png)\n\nThis equation looks complicated, but it's actually just accounting for management tracking error and expense ratios of the LETF ([Zhang 2010](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~avellane/thesis_Zhang.pdf)). Perpetual Pools don't have tracking error or high expense ratios that eat into a traders PnL.\n\nUnder two months of historical ETH/USD data (fig. 1), LETFs perform worse than Perpetual Pool leveraged tokens. LETF performance (orange) was generated using Zhang's equation (2.2.4). In fairness, the best case scenario is assumed, where the expense ratio r, funding rate f and cost of borrowing $\\lambda$ is set to 0\\. The performance of a Perpetual Pool leveraged long token is generated alongside (blue), using the same price data.\n\n![Volatility Decay Equation](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/volatility_decay_rebalancing_33ed400135/volatility_decay_rebalancing_33ed400135.png)\n\nOver the 2 months, when ETH started and ended on roughly the same price, both assets suffer from volatility decay. However, Perpetual Pool leveraged tokens suffer less when compared to an hourly rebalanced LETF.\n\n## Pathway Forward\n\nPerpetual Pools v1 is an effective instrument for **short-term** directional bets.\n\nThe aim of Perpetual Pools v2 is to supports **long-term** directional bets. If the transfer function can address or eliminate structural volatility decay, v2 leveraged tokens will be suitable for long-term holders. Mycelium and Paperclip Fund are actively researching a solution. More details to come in future publications.","description":"Tracer's new financial contract, Perpetual Pools, is most similar to a decentralised Leveraged ETF (LETF).

Following a [successful proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmU4nSSUeUYcpfe5vWVTFUg2A8X6gxLbDYj3rHNB1n2TRo), Tracer DAO will use a batch auction to distribute 5% of its governance token, TCR. That means 50,000,000 TCR will be allocated to bidders from [highest to lowest price, until all units are sold](https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/#/start). The auction will commence at 9am UTC, September 10\\. Bidding is open for 5 days and concludes September 15.\n\n## Overview\n\nIntroducing TCR, Tracer’s native governance token. Gnosis Auction will distribute 50,000,000 TCR governance tokens (5% of the total supply). The auction begins September 10, 2021 at 9am UTC, as decided by governance, and will last for **5 days**. Access [Gnosis Auction here](https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/#/auction?auctionId=45&chainId=1#topAnchor) to participate.\n\n## What is TCR?\n\nTCR is the unique token that governs the Tracer DAO; it's used by DAO members to vote on proposals that determine Tracer's growth and trajectory. By virtue of holding (and staking) TCR, you are entitled to participate in these votes and govern Tracer's peer-to-peer financial ecosystem. DAO members decide when and if to deploy new code, or whether existing code needs to be modified. They also control the use of treasury funds and employment of service providers.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the TCR token provides no ownership, financial or economic rights of any kind.\n\n## What is the Gnosis Auction?\n\nGnosis Auction is a suite of smart contracts that makes a public distribution fair, transparent and decentralised. These open-source contracts allow the public to value and purchase tokens. Gnosis batch auctions settle on a fair price to allocate TCR to participants based on the demand for the token. To find out more, see: [Gnosis FAQ](https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/#/docs/faq#topAnchor).\n\n## Batch Auctions\n\nA batch auction is a way to allocate a set amount of tokens, in this case 50,000,000 TCR, to the Tracer community. Participants place a limit order bid, where they specify an amount of TCR and the price they are willing to pay per token. If a participant's bid price is greater than the clearing price (the bid price at which the last unit is sold), they will be allocated TCR at the clearing price. If a participant's bid is less than the clearing price, they won't receive an allocation. [See here](https://gnosis-auction.eth.link/#/docs/batch-auctions#topAnchor) for further explanation from Gnosis as to how batch auctions calculate the clearing price.\n\n**Important:**\n\n1.  Once the auction begins, participants can start bidding.\n2.  The duration of the sale is 5 days (120 hours).\n3.  The auction has a minimum requirement of a $2,500,000 DAI receipt. If the requirement is not met, the event will fail. Bidders will be reimbursed their DAI, and Tracer DAO will recollect the 50,000,000 TCR. No exchange will take place. Please note the ether (gas) spent to submit the bid order cannot be claimed as it is not held by Gnosis Auction.\n4.  When the auction is finished, participants can claim their TCR at [https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/](https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/#/auction?auctionId=45&chainId=1#topAnchor).\n\n## How do I use Gnosis Auction?\n\nFollow along with Gnosis' ['How to participate as a bidder' guide](https://gnosis-auction.eth.limo/#/docs/participate-as-a-bidder#topAnchor) for a walkthrough of the platform.\n\nYou'll need to connect a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask. Once you've connected a wallet, ensure you have the following cryptocurrencies:\n\n1.  **DAI** – to bid on TCR; and\n2.  **ETH** – to cover the network transaction fees when interacting with the auction contract.\n\nYou can only bid with DAI, so ensure you have the amount you wish to commit when you choose to participate.\n\nThe Gnosis Auction goes live at 9:00 AM (UTC) September 10th. Below is a preview of the Gnosis portal, which will show the TCR auction under the 'Auctions' tab.\n\n![Gnosis Frontend](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/gnosis_frontend_4d8ad55136/gnosis_frontend_4d8ad55136.png)\n\nSuccessful participants can only claim TCR once the auction has concluded on **September 15th.** In the event the auction fails to reach the minimum requirement, participants will need to return to the Gnosis portal post-auction to confirm their DAI refund.\n\n**Auction parameters decided by Tracer DAO**\n\n*   **Total Distribution:** 50,000,000 TCR (5% TCR total supply)\n*   **Auction token:** [TCR](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c4a4204b79dd291d6b6571c5be8bbcd0622f050)\n*   **Bidding Token:** [DAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)\n*   **Minimum price per token:** $0.05 DAI = implied minimum receipt of $2,500,000 DAI (min. fully diluted valuation = $50,000,000 DAI)\n*   **Auction commences:** September 10th 09:00 UTC\n*   **Auction concludes:** September 15th\n\n## Next Steps\n\nTracer DAO's community members and contributors can be found on [Discord](http://discord.gg/PYVs8rVPMd).

Why has this new leveraged product got the DeFi world excited? Until now, there've never been leveraged short or long tokens that have existed on decentralised exchanges, nor one that has the unique properties of the Perpetual Pool token. There are NO margin requirements and NO liquidations for Tracer's leveraged tokens. \n\nLeveraged long and short ERC20s, with the help of DEX infrastructure, can now be fully distributed throughout the DeFi economy. \n\nThis is where [Balancer.fi](https://balancer.fi/) comes in. Because of the composability of the Perpetual Pool token, traders who have entered into a position, leveraged or not, can use their positions as liquidity in other automatic market makers such as Balancer. Not only has the trader got a leveraged position that exists in perpetuity without upkeep, they can now earn additional rewards from providing liquidity through Balancer. Tracer users will be able to earn **substantially more rewards** for providing Perpetual Pool tokens to the secondary market, which was mentioned in the more detailed - [Perpetual Pools Explained](https://tracer.finance/radar/perpetual-pools-explained).\n\nAs of today, Tracer DAO is introducing secondary market liquidity incentives for all traders and stakers using [Balancer Pools](https://balancer.fi/). We’ll outline all you need to know about using the Balancer Pools interface, and maximising for **even more APY** on the [BPT staking](https://pools.tracer.finance/stakebpt/) page. \n\nRead on and get ready.\n\n## What are Balancer Pools?\n\nThink of a Balancer Pool as an automated, market-making portfolio. \n\nEach token asset has an independent weight and can be traded against any other token in the pool. The Balancer Pools created will provide traders with easy access to all Tracer Perpetual Pools tokenised leverage positions. \n\nThere'll be 4 Balancer Pools in total. Each pool will consist of 3 assets required to provide liquidity: the long side of the pool, the short side of the pool and either wBTC or wETH. There is a difference between the collateral requirements and weightings for the 1x and 3x leveraged pools, which is explained below. \n\n**1x Pools**\nThe liquidity pool for the 1x tokens contain the long side of the pool, the short side of the pool and USDC. These pools have a standard swap fee of 0.3%. The weightings for 1x Balancer Pools are as follows:\n\n- 33.3% USDC\n- 33.3% long tokens\n- 33.3% short tokens\n\n**3x Pools**\nThe liquidity pool for 3x tokens contain the long side of the pool, the short side of the pool and wBTC / wETH (depending on the market of the pool tokens). A higher swap fee is charged on the 3x pools to account for the greater amount of volatility decay experienced. The weightings for 3x Balancer Pools are as follows:\n\n- 50% wBTC or wETH\n- 17% long tokens\n- 33% short tokens\n\nIf you, a trader, only provide one or two of the required assets, Balancer will weight the pool accordingly and charge a small fee for the transaction. To optimise liquidity providing in the Balancer Pools, you should provide all 3 assets needed for the pool. You can provide liquidity in the following 4 pools:\n\n- 1-BTC/USD;\n- 3-BTC/USD;\n- 1-ETH/USD; and\n- 3-ETH/USD.\n\nBalancer Pools were selected because they utilise a generalisation of the constant product AMM for more than two assets. This allows the creation of liquidity pools containing the Perpetual Pools collateral asset (USDC) and the long and short pool tokens. By creating a 3 asset Balancer pool, liquidity is concentrated in a single pool; and users can exchange all 3 assets while *only incurring a single swap fee*.\n\nBalancer Pools provide a new level of access to Tracer's tokenised leveraged positions. You now have the option to gain exposure to leveraged long and short positions for ETH and BTC without the need to mint via [https://pools.tracer.finance/](https://pools.tracer.finance/). These fungible positions now allow users to interact with the DeFi economy seamlessly and sustain their leveraged exposure.\n\n## Liquidity Mining Rewards\n\nTo earn secondary market liquidity rewards, users will stake BLT tokens into the staking farm contract [here](https://pools.tracer.finance/stakebpt/). Liquidity mining rewards accrue continuously and can be claimed at any time. These rewards are determined by the proportion of pool tokens provided by the unique address in the staking contract.\n\n- e.g. A user deposits 10 BLT tokens. There are a total of 100 BLT tokens in the staking contract. Therefore, this user has a 10% claim on the TCR rewards for that hour.\n\nLiquidity mining rewards favour secondary market liquidity providers. 60% of the total 5% allocation will be given to secondary market liquidity.\n\n## What's your next move?\n\nDive in the pool! Use the following step-by-step walkthrough to help guide you around providing liquidity to Balancer. Check out the Balancer Pools [here](https://arbitrum.balancer.fi/#/) to get instant access to fully-fungible tokenised leverage positions; or provide liquidity to earn TCR in the BLT staking farm contracts. \n\nStay updated on Tracer's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO) and join the [Discord](http://discord.gg/PYVs8rVPMd) to connect with us and talk to the team, we're looking forward to hearing from you. \n\n\n## Guide to Providing Liquidity on Balancer\n\nNote: If this is your first time using Balancer, we recommend [following this guide](https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/walkthroughs/invest).\n\n### Step 1: Connect\n\nSelect the Arbitrum network and connect your wallet. \n\n### Step 2: Pick your pool\n\nHere, you will need to use the search function to enter the token address.\n\nThe full list of token addresses are as follows:\n\n**1L-ETH/USD**\t0x38c0a5443c7427e65a9bf15ae746a28bb9a052cc\n\n**1S-ETH/USD**\t0xf581571dbcced3a59aaacbf90448e7b3e1704dcd\n\n**3L-ETH/USD**\t0xaa846004dc01b532b63feaa0b7a0cb0990f19ed9\n\n**3S-ETH/USD**\t0x7d7e4f49a29dda8b1ecdcf8a8bc85edcb234e997\n\n**1L-BTC/USD**\t0x1616bf7bbd60e57f961e83a602b6b9abb6e6cafc\n\n**1S-BTC/USD**\t0x052814194f459af30edb6a506eabfc85a4d99501\n\n**3L-BTC/USD**\t0x05a131b3cd23be0b4f7b274b3d237e73650e543d\n\n**3S-BTC/USD**\t0x85700dc0bfd128dd0e7b9ed38496a60bac698fc8\n\n### Step 3: Pool management\n\nClick on the desired pool to navigate to the pool management page.\n\n### Step 4: Select your amount\n\nYou can choose to invest one token, a subset of tokens, or all of them. The pool will calculate how many pool tokens (BPTs) to give you for your input tokens. If you join the pool according to pool weights (\"Best price\"), you will not create any price impact. If you join in an unbalanced way (\"Custom amounts\") you may impact the price.\n\n*[Balancer:](https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/walkthroughs/invest#select-your-amount)* *If your \"Custom amounts\" join has significant price impact, it may be cheaper to swap your tokens to match the \"Best price\" amounts. If you significantly impact the price in a pool, you can create an arbitrage opportunity that someone else may profit from.*\n\n### Step 5: Approve token(s)\n\nClick \"Invest\" to add tokens to the pool.\n\nFor more information on withdrawing liquidity on Balancer, please read this FAQ: [https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/faqs/liquidity](https://docs.balancer.fi/getting-started/faqs/liquidity)\n\n\n## Guide to Staking your BLTs on Tracer\n\n### Step 1: Enter the interface\n\nEnter the BLT Staking interface here: [https://pools.tracer.finance/stakebpt/](https://pools.tracer.finance/stakebpt/)\n\n### Step 2: Stake\n\nSelect 'Stake' and approve the transaction.\n\nThere is no vesting for TCR rewards.

Code is reviewed, vulnerabilities are disclosed, bug hunters are paid and crypto’s unrivalled security is further strengthened. \n\nWith Immunefi's help, Tracer DAO aims to **discover, disclose, mitigate and eliminate** any potential security risks within its smart contracts. The bug bounty program is focused on smart contracts and is primarily concerned with preventing loss of user funds and system deadlocking.\n\nThere’s no single reward rate for bugs found – the bugs lodged are sorted according to threat level and rewards are distributed based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification system. You can find more information and details on how this classification scaling works in the Immunefi documentation here: [https://immunefi.com/severity-updated/](https://immunefi.com/severity-updated/). Below is the reward schedule according to the level of the vulnerability found:\n\n**Critical:** Up to $1,000,000 USDC;\n\n**High**: $50,000 USDC;\n\n**Medium**: $10,000 USDC; and\n\n**Low**: $1,000 USDC.\n\n\n### Scope\n\nThe scope of the bug bounty is discussed extensively in the following document: [https://immunefi.com/bounty/tracer/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/tracer/). Primarily, the bug bounty scope is looking for the following things:\n\n- Loss of user funds;\n- Deadlocking of system; and\n- Contract failures (where no loss of value necessarily occurs).\n\nThese are the key bugs in which we are interested in discovering. However, there are additional vulnerabilities in which Tracer DAO is interested in receiving. Those who flag these bugs will be rewarded accordingly.\n\n\n### Summary\n\nSecurity is one of the guiding principles in our community and we want you to know that it is our promise to continue strengthening our security through various community actions and development – and this is all made possible by you, so don't wait to get involved: [https://immunefi.com/bounty/tracer/](https://immunefi.com/bounty/tracer/).

Any asset / asset type can in principle be bridged, including Ether, ERC20 tokens, ERC-721 tokens, etc.[[1]](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets#:~:text=The%20Arbitrum%20protocol%27s%20ability%20to%20pass%20messages%20between%20L1%20and%20L2%20can%20be%20leveraged%20to%20trustlessly%20move%20assets%20from%20Ethereum%20to%20an%20Arbitrum%20chain%20and%20back.%20Any%20asset%20/%20asset%20type%20can%20in%20principle%20be%20bridged%2C%20including%20Ether%2C%20ERC20%20tokens%2C%20ERC-721%20tokens%2C%20etc.)*\n\n### Token Bridging \n\nUsing Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum will position Tracer’s infrastructure to support innovative market creation efficiently and help power the future of finance. However, as with any nascent technology, there are some additional steps required to interact with Arbitrum before using the Tracer suite of products. \n\nAs Arbitrum (L2) exists as a scalability solution for Ethereum (L1), the Arbitrum architecture naturally exists in part on L1 and in part on L2. Therefore, if a user has assets on the Ethereum (L1) mainchain, they will need to bridge their assets to Arbitrum (L2) in order to interact with the exciting new DeFi protocols such as [https://pools.tracer.finance/](https://pools.tracer.finance/)\n\nIn this guide we will walk you through the process of bridging your assets from L1 to L2. \n\n### Step 1: Add Arbitrum One to your Metamask\n\nYou can [read this documentation]\n(https://docs.tracer.finance/tutorials/add-arbitrum-mainnet-to-metamask) and follow along with the video.\n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/e6813f1281c94eba9e79193f201f2a98\">\n    <p>Watch - Adding Arbitrum to Metamask </p>\n    <img style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/e6813f1281c94eba9e79193f201f2a98-with-play.gif\">\n  </a>\n\n\n### Step 2:  Connect to Arbitrum\n\nHead to [https://bridge.arbitrum.io/](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/)  and connect to your Metamask by signing a transaction. \nThere should be no fee to do so. \n<a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/1eaed2d0a62b4869a6b3402843d7d8c6\">\n    <p>Watch - Connect to Arbitrum One </p>\n    <img style=\"max-width:300px;\" src=\"https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/1eaed2d0a62b4869a6b3402843d7d8c6-with-play.gif\">\n  </a>\n\n### Step 3: Transfer\n\nSelect the asset and how much you wish to deposit to L2. Click deposit and the Metamask window will appear. Now sign the transaction. \n\nNote: The bridging can take up to 10 minutes to process. \n\n### Step 4: Switch Networks\n\nNow switch networks on your Metamask wallet. Your assets should be visible on the assets tab.\n\n![bridging-assets-arbitrum (1).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/bridging_assets_arbitrum_1_2e91a5178b/bridging_assets_arbitrum_1_2e91a5178b.png)\n\n### Learn more about Arbitrum\n\nFor more information about using Arbitrum we have these two resources.  \n\n- [Arbitrum FAQ](https://tracer.finance/radar/arbitrum-faqs)\n- [Arbitrum in 10 Minutes](https://tracer.finance/radar/arbitrum-in-under-10)\n\nOr visit [Arbitrum Documentation.](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/bridging_assets)\n\n### More help guides\n\n- [Bridging your tokens to Arbitrum](https://tracer.finance/radar/bridging-to-arbitrum)\n- [Creating a custom RPC](https://tracer.finance/radar/remote-procedure-call-creating-an-rpc)\n- [How to mint and burn pool tokens](https://tracer.finance/radar/minting-burning)\n- [How to stake your pool tokens](https://tracer.finance/radar/staking)","description":"Bridging tokens to Arbitrum for Perpetual Pools.

We're going to walk you through the process of minting and burning pool tokens with this guide. \n\nGaining access to non-liquidatable, tokenised leverage is no longer a pain point for DeFi users thanks to Tracer's Perpetual Pools: a product that allows you to trade fully-fungible positions, which means you can *seamlessly* interact with and sustain your leveraged exposure within the DeFi economy. It's simple, straightforward and we'll support you with every step. \n\nNow let's get you started with minting your first token.\n\n# Minting Pool Tokens\n\n### Step 1: Browse\n\nHead to [Perpetual Pools](https://pools.tracer.finance/) and browse the tokens available. You'll be able to see long and short tokens for the 1BTC, 1ETH, 3BTC and 3ETH. Take note of the expected rebalancing rate for each token as this will influence your returns.\n\n![minting-1.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/minting_1_58afb41734/minting_1_58afb41734.png)\n\n### Step 2: Exchange\n\nSelect 'Exchange' to get started minting your pool tokens.\n\n### Step 3: Market\n\nFind the market you wish to go long or short on by clicking the drop-down and choosing either BTC/USDC or ETH/USDC.\n\n### Step 4: Side\n\nPick what side of the pool you wish to enter by selecting 'long' or 'short' depending on the position you want to take.\n\n### Step 5: Power leverage\n\nChoose your power leverage. Right now, Perpetual Pools only offers 1 and 3 power leverage positions. \n\n![minting-2.gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/minting_2_a6b5bb93e4/minting_2_a6b5bb93e4.gif)\n\n### Step 6: Amount\n\nIt's time to provide your USDC as collateral. There's a minimum of $1000 USDC for minting and burning. We suggest placing an order over $1000 USDC to make sure you meet the minimum requirement to burn your tokens when exiting your position.\n\n### Step 7: Unlock USDC\n\nUnlock your USDC to start investing with Tracer by selecting the 'Unlock USDC' button. This is a one-time transaction for each pool.\n\n### Step 8: Mint!\n\nMint your tokens! Select, 'Ok, let's mint' and follow the MetaMask prompts. Once accepted, your order will be put into the queue and you'll receive your tokens at the end of the next rebalancing event.\n\n![minting-3.gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/minting_3_9a6e059cb8/minting_3_9a6e059cb8.gif)\n\n### Step 9: Add to MetaMask\n\nTo add the token address to your MetaMask, view the tokens in the 'Browse' tab. Find the token you wish to add to your MetaMask and click the 3 dots next to 'Burn'. Select 'Add token to wallet' and follow the MetaMask prompts. \n\n![minting-4.gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/minting_4_aa33013ed7/minting_4_aa33013ed7.gif)\n\nCongratulations, you've just successfully minted your very first pool tokens! These tokens a fully-fungible ERC20s to be used throughout the DeFi economy. Now let's look at some next steps.\n\n\n\n# Burning Pool Tokens\n\n### Step 1: Browse\n\nHead back over to [Perpetual Pools](https://pools.tracer.finance/) and browse through the list of tokens available. You'll notice that the pool tokens you hold will have the 'BURN' button highlighted alongside the 'MINT' button.\n\n![minting-5.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/minting_5_7b28375440/minting_5_7b28375440.png)\n\n### Step 2:  Exchange\n\nSelect 'BURN' for the token you want to burn and you'll be brought to the 'Exchange' page, where you'll begin the dead-simple process of burning your pool tokens.\n\n### Step 3: Amount\n\nYou'll see the token you selected to burn in the 'Token' section. All you have to do now is enter the amount of tokens you want to burn. If you want to burn all of your selected pool tokens, click 'Max'. \n\n### Step 4: Burn\n\nChoose 'Ok, let's burn' and accept the MetaMask prompts. This burn order will be placed into the queue and you'll receive your USDC at the end of the next rebalancing event. \n\n![minting-6.gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/minting_6_9a8299c9ba/minting_6_9a8299c9ba.gif)\n\nCongratulations, you've successfully burned your pool tokens!\n\nTracer's Perpetual Pools interface was designed with ease of use and access in mind.

Here’s what it means for Tracer DAO:\n\n\n## The What:\n\nThe Tracer DAO treasury is pursuing liquidity provisioning to the TCR-ETH pair on Uniswap v3 for both Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\nTracer will have Visor Finance oversee the pools as they are a Uniswap v3 active manager with a committed focus on liquidity provisioning strategies to ensure the  liquidity position is 'in-range' and maximises capital efficiency. This will be executed by supplying the liquidity for both pools using its treasury funds to a Position Management Hypervisor.\n\nRight now, Visor Finance manages over 20 pairs on Uniswap v3; and provide an infrastructure for protocols to utilise their own treasury to provide liquidity, while simultaneously generating yield.\n\nThis treasury management service is targeted, effective and expeditious in catering to the individual needs of the protocols serviced by Visor Finance, with the additional feature of co-management.\n\nTracer DAO's aim for deeper liquidity of TCR will then enable *more* active governors to join the protocol with a *reduced barrier to entry.*\n\n\n## The Why:\n\nSlippage on Sushiswap (both on Mainnent and Arbitrum) is noticeably high because of the lack of liquidity. This slippage means people can't easily purchase TCR tokens to effectively govern the way that they trade.\n\nWe understood and anticipated this as a probability; and this is our solution. If you were to, for example, look at a trade of around ~$3,000 USD, you’ll see that it’ll suffer an approximate 2% slippage on Mainnet; and a bit more on Arbitrum. \n\nThis means that it’s imperative that we work to increase the liquidity for the TCR-ETH trading pair. \n\nThis is where Visor Finance comes in; and our partnership will provide a bulwark against this slippage, while generating liquidity.\n\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nTracer’s all about forging ahead with innovative thinking and action. Our partnership with Visor Finance will address the urgent need for trading liquidity on the secondary markets. The capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 makes it possible for Tracer to provide that liquidity with our own treasury funds. \n\nThis is a cost saving move that eliminates the need for liquidity mining rewards for TCR, in addition to, of course, generating extra yield for the treasury.\n\nYou can read more about Visor Finance here: [https://www.visor.finance](https://www.visor.finance/) \n\nExciting stuff is happening and we want you to be part of it.

The column highlighted in the below image depicts the effective leverage.\n\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-13 at 2.45.55 pm.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_2_45_55_pm_6b78693d38/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_2_45_55_pm_6b78693d38.png)\n\nWhen the leverage for gains is different than for losses, the pools are skewed. This presents an arbitrage opportunity we call 'Skew Farming', because the polarised leverage is caused by collateral skew.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: The following steps are for demonstration purposes only. The calculations are done assuming an ETH price of $3000. Do not expect GIFs to reflect the values used in the calculations. It is recommended you obtain your own financial advice before proceeding.*\n\n1. What we'll do is take a position in the side with better leverage on gains. At the same time, we'll also take the opposite position of equal magnitude on another platform.\n\n\n2. Look at the 3-ETH pool in the browse tab (shown above). The leverage is different for gains and losses, so skew exists. The leverage on gains is higher for the short side, which means it has asymmetric upside. You only lose at a leverage of 3, but when you win it's at 3.22.\n\n\n3. Let's mint some **short tokens**. You can follow the guide on how to mint and burn pool tokens [here](https://tracer.finance/radar/minting-burning).\n\n\n![GIF - MINT.gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/ezgif_1_91bf7703e8d0_1_c8ed379b90/ezgif_1_91bf7703e8d0_1_c8ed379b90.gif)\n\n\nNow that we have leveraged short tokens, we can take the opposite position by buying ETH. We're buying the long position to counter any losses we might have from the leveraged tokens.\n\n4. Use an AMM or exchange to purchase the equivalent value of ETH. Remember that our leveraged position loses at a leverage of 3, so you'll need three times the ETH long.\n\n\n![GIF - Buying 3000 eth.gif](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/GIF_Buying_3000_eth_3b0f9d1d2a/GIF_Buying_3000_eth_3b0f9d1d2a.gif)\n\n\n5. You could also take a long position on a perpetual swap platform, using leverage to make this strategy more efficient. \n\nThe price has gone down and the S-tokens won! They've increased in value, but we also lost money on the ETH in our wallet. Let's compare the value of the Perpetual Pool position and our spot position. \n\nThe ETH price decreased by 1% and our short position went from $1000 → $1031.89. Our long position went from $3000 → $2970. In total, a gain of $31.89 - $30 = $1.89.\n\nWhat happens if the ETH price increases by 1%? Our short position goes from $1000 → $970.59. The ETH we bought went from $3000 → $3030. Resulting in a net profit of $30 - $29.41 = $0.59.\n\nIf you don't want to wait to mint tokens, you can buy leveraged tokens on [Balancer right away](https://arbitrum.balancer.fi/#/). That way, you don't change the composition of Tracer's Perpetual Pools and can get exposure immediately.\n\nThere's plenty of opportunity to farm the skew - check out the Pools with polarised leverage now and use this arbitrage strategy. Join the community and ask the team questions in the [Tracer Discord](https://www.notion.so/tracerdao/discord.gg/PYVs8rVPMd).\n\n*Please note, 'Skew Farming' is conceptual model and does not constitute financial advice.

Until now, existing leveraged tokens have been built on top of more complicated systems like the perpetual swap or another method of borrowing such as Compound/Aave. These existing leveraged tokens are typically centralised; where the traders trust an entity to rebalance the pool.\n\n## How it Works\n\nLeveraged tokens specify a fixed leverage that they'll track (e.g. 3x) and provide returns in line with this specification. As the price moves for the underlying asset, this position's leverage will diverge from what's intended. These tokens thus require **rebalancing** - the act of selling or buying the underlying asset(s) in order to regain the intended leverage. \n\nThese tokens have differing criteria that triggers their rebalancing - some are price-based triggers and some are time based. \n\n## **Leveraged ETFs**\n\nLeveraged tokens aren't new. These tokens are a modern-take on Leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – a financial instrument that's been around for some time in traditional finance. These ETFs gain leverage by holding a combination of debt and the underlying asset, which are then wrapped into shares that are freely tradable. Traders trust the management of the ETF to rebalance the fund to its target leverage (usually limited to 2x or 3x) at the end of each day.\n\nThese instruments have vulnerabilities. LETFs are not inherently immune to liquidation. These ETFs warn that while they manage the fund closely, a liquidation (bankruptcy) is always possible. However, LETF firms note that by use of the exchanges \"circuit breaker\" mechanism, (which stops trading during market free-fall) they're generally immune to such liquidations.\n\nLETFs charge around 0.5% to 3% per year to manage the fund but also lose equity over time for the interest rate on borrowed funds, as well as for the slippage to rebalance the portfolio to target leverage. *The result is a fungible leveraged asset that has a higher cost than manually maintaining a leveraged position, has a nonzero chance of liquidation, and is limited in leverage to 3x due to regulation.*\n\n## DeFi Leveraged Tokens\n\nIn cryptocurrency, the demand for leveraged tokens has also been fulfilled by using trusted centralised third parties. Leveraged tokens such as ETHBEAR and ETHBULL were created that roughly provide 3x leveraged exposure to Ethereum. A centralised trusted entity manages a perpetual swap or lending platform position and sells shares of this position – they also charge a management fee that is generally 1% per year. \n\nYou'll see in the following graph: FTX annual management fee of 10.95% and Binance charge an annual management fee of 3.65% at the time of writing.\n\nEven if a decentralised trustless system for managing a leveraged portfolio and selling shares of it were used, the system would be complex and likely built on top of a complicated system such as a perpetual swap. It's possible to come close to the ideal trustless leveraged derivative in this manner, but with the slippage, market liquidity risk, and system complexity risk; it's possible to make a far simpler and more affordable leveraged token.\n\n![Leveraged-token-compare.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Leveraged_token_compare_2908180a4c/Leveraged_token_compare_2908180a4c.png)\n\n\n---\n\n## Tracer Perpetual Pools\n\nTracer Perpetual Pools are a breeze in terms of user experience because it's simplified, charges a fraction of the standard management fee the crypto industry charges (and moderately less than average of LETF counterparts), does not incur slippage, only pays the effective interest rate (via pool imbalance), can operate under any leverage and most significantly; Tracer Perpetual Pools are *trustless*. [See here for a description of the Tracer Perpetual Pools mechanism.](https://tracer.finance/static/Tracer%20Perpetual%20Pools-efc7c29f638cb788832aafe0f41c07bd.pdf)\n\nBecause Perpetual Pools don't require ownership of the underlying, they're unique in the market in three ways:\n\n### 1. Leverage is less constrained\n\nAs seen in the above figure, leverages for the market are constrained within the range of (plus or minus) 5x – bar the exception of FTX. This limits the exposure that users can acquire on a directional (long or short) bet. \n\nWe believe this is against the ethos of open finance. \n\nPerpetual Pools V1 currently has leverage multipliers that range between power leverage of 3 (either long or short), however we intend to expand this for v2 to allow users to deploy a market with any specified leverage multiplier. \n\nBecause Tracer doesn't require ownership of any underlying, it means that it can provide markets at significantly higher leverages. This also imbues Tracer with a significant competitive advantage insofar as it doesn't have to worry about liquidation or rebalancing the underlying assets held within LETFs. Leveraged token managers who build these instruments with underlying assets have to worry about constantly rebalancing their position to maintain the intended leverage, which adds the risk of liquidation, as well as further costs like slippage. These instruments usually maintain their leverage within a range of the intended leverage – ultimately they have the worst of both worlds: they don't maintain an intended leverage and they don't rebalance often. \n\nTracer Perpetual Pools maintains its intended leverage if the capital between sides is equal; **and *never* requires rebalancing of the underlying assets – it's all in the power of the swap agreement.\n\n### 2. Tracer Perpetual Pools is cheaper\n\nTracer Perpetual Pools doesn't face slippage costs, transaction costs, or price impact because there's no underlying asset that's purchased/sold (unlike LETFs).\n\nThese leveraged tokens to date usually acquire their leverage via a perpetual swap or another method of borrowing such as Compound/Aave. This incurs borrowing costs (whether explicitly, or implicitly in the case of a perpetual swap funding rates). \n\nHowever, because there's no actual debt that's being borrowed in Perpetual Pools v1, there's no funding lost because it's all kept within the ecosystem (either within the long side or the short side). For Tracer Perpetual Pools V2, we anticipate launching with aDAI as a settlement quote asset, which would enable users to *gain interest while maintaining their position*. \n\nFree from the expensive process of constant rebalancing and requiring a team of portfolio managers on standby, Tracer Perpetual Pools is radically cheaper than its competitors who charge eye-watering fees to facilitate all of these actions and maintenance. Tracer Perpetual Pools V1 (and V2) only take a 1% clip of TVL, annually. This is in line with Traditional LETFs and is significantly cheaper than FTX at 10%. Tracer V1 and V2 will not charge a mint and burn fee – unlike its competitors. \n\n### 3. Bankruptcy is fundamentally impossible within Perpetual Pools\n\nTracer Perpetual Pools is actively making the mechanism trustless and open-source. This cannot be said for its competitors! LETFs have a \"circuit breaker\" to prevent bankruptcy, FTX and Binance have a closed-source bot, for example.\n\nRight now, creation of new markets is limited to developers for Tracer Perpetual Pools V1, but in V2 we'll allow users to permissionlessly deploy a Perpetual Pool market. \n\nTracer V1 security is currently enforced via the trust of the dev multisigs. In V2, this will move away from multisigs to have pools secured completely by the blockchain. All competitors' Leveraged Tokens are relatively transparent in terms of how they ensure their maintenance of said leverage, [except for Binance](https://medium.com/@Austerity_Sucks/binance-launches-copycat-leveraged-tokens-are-they-really-better-for-traders-fb01e613f532). \n\n## What the Key Differences Mean\n\nLeveraged Tokens are not new, they're a modern-day implementation of Leveraged ETFs. \n\nThe problem with LETFs, and many leveraged tokens, is that they require holding the underlying asset and having debt, too. This makes rebalancing expensive and has the spectre of liquidation and bankruptcy hovering as a risk possibility. \n\nPerpetual Pools is *fundamentally different*. It's a mechanism whereby leveraged tokens can be created via ownership over a pool of collateral, where the value transfer simulates leveraged exposure – without the downsides of leveraged tokens.","description":"Leveraged tokens abstract out re-margining and rebalancing, simplifying the user experience of managing a position.

They can also mitigate counterparty risks by buying credit default swaps and insurance. \n\nToday, Tracer has bridged another gap for DeFi by integrating with [Risk Harbor](https://www.riskharbor.com/) - a completely automated, transparent and impartial claims process to protect liquidity providers and traders against smart contract risk and attacks. Users of Tracer's Perpetual Pools now have the option to protect their positions against hacks through Risk Harbor.\n\n**Why Risk Harbor?** \n\nUnlike other smart contract protection protocols, Risk Harbor has a claims process free of any human input or bias, making payouts in ~45 seconds. The Tracer >|< Risk Harbor partnership is another first, bringing smart contract insurance to the Layer 2 solution Arbitrum. \n\nTo initiate the partnership (Phase 1), Tracer users will be able to purchase protection for the 1S-BTC/USD Perpetual Pool via [https://app.riskharbor.com/](https://app.riskharbor.com/)\n\n*Example \"a potential policyholder will pay when purchasing protection from the protocol. For example, if a user purchased 100 yDAI worth of protection at a price point of 5%, they would pay 5 yDAI upfront in premiums\" [See Docs](https://docs.riskharbor.com/protocol-overview/pricing#:~:text=Powered%20by%20GitBook-,Pricing%20%26%20Purchasing,-When%20underwriters%20deposit)*\n\nIn anticipation of Phase 2, we're working towards Tracer users being able to purchase cover for the remaining Perpetual Pools: 1L-BTC/USD, 1S-ETH/USD, 1L-ETH/USD, as well as the leveraged 3x Pools. \n\n**How does it work?** \n\nUnderwriters agree to cover a Potential Policyholder's loss in the event of a hack or attack on the protocol in exchange for premiums paid upfront, as well as the compromised token itself if a claim is made. This type of financial derivative is known in traditional financial markets as a Credit Default Swap (CDS).\n\n![image (5).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/image_5_c53cd05a98/image_5_c53cd05a98.png)\n\nIn a claiming event - A policyholder can swap ERC20 claim tokens for USDC, almost instantly. \n\nExample:\n\n1. Hack event occurs\n2. Policy holder initiates transaction\n3. The Risk Harbor contract receives a request and automatically checks its redeemibility \n4. The underwriter receives the claim token and simultaneously the policy holder receives the payout.\n\n![image (6).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/image_6_d6d979eb3c/image_6_d6d979eb3c.png)\n\n**What are the risks for underwriters?** \n\nUnderwriters will bear the losses of any hack, attack or any other loss event that causes the redeemable USDC to fall below 90% of the target amount. This includes smart contract risk, hacks, rug pulls, misspecified contracts and flash loan attacks.\n\n**What are the risks for policyholders?**\n\nIf a hack occurs, the policyholder will be paid out in USDC. So unless USDC loses its peg, policyholders will be protected. \n\nTracer welcomes this partnership and continues to build risk mitigation systems for our users.

Tracer is one of only 5 projects to win the C.o.R.E. event and claim an initial reactor. This partnership will showcase the strength of Tokemak's market making mechanism and pave the way for further reactors that contain Perpetual Pool tokens! Thanks to all who voted for Tracer in the week long event — it's safe to say that we were C.o.R.E.'s dark horse. \n\nOn the back of a vote just passed by Tracer DAO, TCR holders will soon be able to deposit into the reactor and start earning TOKE. This is the first time there's been single asset staking for TCR! \n\nTracer is the smallest project by market cap to get a reactor, so the relative yield from daily rewards (700 TOKE) is potentially the highest for our stakers. Head over to the [tokemak.xyz](http://tokemak.xyz) website to get started. \n\nWe expect this reactor will deepen liquidity for TCR significantly. Right now, our partner, [Visor Finance](https://tracer.finance/radar/visor-finance), are handling most of the market making for Tracer on Uniswap v3 (mainnet). They're actively managing LP positions for the TCR/ETH pair with $0.5M of each asset. \n\nLiquidity provider (LP) deposits are single-sided for Tokemak reactors, so all you have to do is provide TCR. Simply deposit TCR and receive tTCR, which is redeemable 1:1 for the asset in the reactor (TCR). There'll be a period before this liquidity is directed to a platform for market making so, in the meantime, you can sit tight and earn TOKE.\n\nTokemak intends to protect single-sided liquidity providers (TCR depositors) from impermanent loss. Tokemak uses a TCR reserve to support the 1:1 redemption and Tracer DAO will provide this reserve.\n\nTokemak and Tracer have agreed to swap $1.5M USD of native protocol tokens to seed the reactor. The TOKE received gives Tracer DAO the power to direct TCR liquidity to various platforms. See the [proposal on Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmUdFBrfVNYHkrMVG9uEw3owznLp1BNnU4WYxfPD69fuF4) for more details!\n\nGet ready for TCR staking and TOKE rewards.\n\nNew to Tracer?

Perpetual Pools utilises Chainlink Price Feeds hourly to determine the value transfer between long and short sides of a pool; and to move funds between users in the pools.\n\nDeFi users can now gain access to non-liquidatable, fully-fungible tokenised leverage on a platform secured by trustless [oracle](https://blog.chain.link/what-is-the-blockchain-oracle-problem/) infrastructure. Our initial integration involves the use of the following Chainlink Price Feeds: ETH-USD and BTC-USD, with the ability to scale up in the future to meet ecosystem demand. These Price Feeds underscore the Perpetual Pools mechanism, opening up a new experience where [DeFi](https://chain.link/education/defi) users have a sustainable leverage token to go long or short on any asset.\n\n[Perpetual Pools is a new financial primitive](https://tracer.finance/radar/perpetual-pools-explained) that allows you to take a short or long position on any underlying asset. These positions are non-liquidatable, fully collateralised, fully-fungible and can exist perpetually without upkeep – they exist as ERC20 leveraged tokens that live inside your wallet. These tokens enable you to seamlessly interact with the DeFi economy – you can mint your beliefs (whether they be short or long) and leverage your exposure to those beliefs.\n\nWhat's great about these leveraged tokens is that they can earn you TCR rewards. How? By minting and staking in Tracer's staking contracts using the super easy, user friendly Perpetual Pools interface. You can check out our step-by-step guide on the minting and burning process using that interface, [right here](https://tracer.finance/radar/minting-burning).\n\nAfter reviewing various oracle solutions, Tracer DAO selected Chainlink Price Feeds because they provide access to the highest quality data, with broad market coverage and robust oracle infrastructure that's proven to be reliable during extreme network conditions; along with various on-chain monitoring systems that allow users to verify the integrity and performance of oracle networks. This results in highly accurate, timely, tamper-proof, and transparent price reference data that’s made accessible on-chain for our smart contracts to consume in a single function call.\n\n![chainlink-oracle-price-feeds.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/chainlink_oracle_price_feeds_4cc5a4a9eb/chainlink_oracle_price_feeds_4cc5a4a9eb.png)\n\n### Access Digital and Real World Markets with Chainlink Oracles\n\nTracer's infrastructure lets users gain exposure to any digital and real-world market with an oracle price feed by forming simple derivative agreements. By porting existing price data on-chain with strong uptime, correctness, and tamper-resistance guarantees, countless new local and global markets can be formed that allow both individuals and firms to manage their risk.\n\nInstead of being at the mercy of fluctuating market prices (for example, fuel prices), consumers can lock in their prices with a simple, easy-to-use derivative contract. With fast, zero-permission deployment for Perpetual Pools, Tracer can capture markets as soon as there's a trusted price oracle.\n\n\"Integrating Chainlink Price Feeds into Tracer's Perpetual Pools was a seamless process, with us now being able to support every single Chainlink Price Feed out of the box, simply given the feed address. Secure and reliable price feeds are the most critical piece of infrastructure for Tracer, as they enable the movement of funds between users in each perpetual pool, allowing the protocol itself to work. Being such a critical piece, it has always been important that we have reliable and consistent price data, which Chainlink has provided.\" - Raymond Mogg, a core Tracer DAO contributor.\n\n### **About Chainlink**\n\nChainlink is the industry standard for building, accessing, and selling oracle services needed to power hybrid smart contracts on any blockchain.

Perpetual Pools is a derivative contract that swaps collateral between the long and short sides of one pool – when the collateral is unequal between these sides, the pool is 'skewed' which results in the swap agreement creating polarised leverage. Those who exploit the benefits of this particular leverage are called basis farmers, or **skew farmers.** \n\nLike basis farming in Perpetual Swaps, these farmers can earn consistent returns while they remain delta-neutral. We've put together this guide to walk you through how to generate excess risk-adjusted returns:\n\n# 1. Strategy\n\n## Overview\n\nTo reiterate, when the pool is skewed, the swap agreement creates polarised leverage. Traders in an under-collateralised side of a pool make *more* than the intended leverage when they win, while traders in an over-collateralised side make *less* when they win. \n\nIt's important to note that collateral skew has *no effect on losses*. Regardless of the skew, each side always loses at the intended leverage. \n\n\n## Constructing a Delta-Neutral Position\n\nCreate a delta-neutral position with equal notional value of: (a) pool tokens from an under collateralised side; and (b) the underlying asset. \n\nYour first step is to mint pool tokens on the [pools.tracer.finance](http://pools.tracer.finance) site. Determine the most profitable pools to farm by clicking on \"Browse\" and then sorting by \"Effective Gain\". This sorting function lists pool positions with the greatest effective gain to the least. \n\n*For example, suppose 3S-ETH (Tracer's 3p short ETH derivative) has an effective gain of 3.3 (representing 10% more collateral in the long pool). Anyone holding 3S-ETH is effectively paid interest to have a short position.*\n\nFollowing the above example, consider theoretically taking a $1000 position in the 3S-ETH side of the pool. If you don't want short exposure and just want to collect the 'interest', you should delta hedge (to neutral) by acquiring long ETH exposure. \n\n*Say the ETH price is $3000 and you need to acquire +1 ETH to cancel out your short position. If this ETH was from a spot market, the total capital requirement is $4000 (1000 for pool position + 3000 for spot position). If you were to use a perpetual swap instead, with 10x leverage to hedge, the total capital requirement would be $1300 (1000 + 300).*\n\n\n## Profiting from Skew\n\nTraders can farm skew from this delta-neutral position. At the upcoming value transfer, the underlying price will either appreciate or depreciate, causing a value transfer to the long or short side of the pool, respectively.\n\n**Price appreciates:** *If the ETH price goes up 0.1% in a single hour, the long position would gain $3 (0.1% * $3000) and the 3S-ETH would lose $3 (0.1% * 3p leverage * $1000); netting $0.* \n\n**Price depreciates:** I*f the price goes down 0.1% instead, the long position would lose $3 (0.1% * $3000) and the 3S-ETH would gain $3.30 (0.1% * 1.1 skew * 3p leverage * $1000); netting $0.30. If the ETH always had an hourly volatility of 0.1%, the holder of these 2 positions could expect (on average) to make $0.15 per hour on $1300 of capital.* \n\n\n## Profiting from PnL Compression\n\nAnother unique aspect of Perpetual Pools, the Power Leverage formula (used to determine the collateral swap), serves to increase yield for skew farmers. This formula behaves virtually the same as traditional leverage for normal price movements – but continuously dampens effective leverage as changes in the underlying price become more drastic. We call this effect, *PnL compression. \n\nPnL compression* reduces both the profit and the loss of the derivative. What this means for skew farmers is that on the rare occasion that the underlying price moves by more than around 1 percent in a single hour, the PnL compression effect starts to become noticeable. \n\n**Price appreciates:** *Suppose the hedged positions described earlier were to experience a 5% increase in the underlying price in a single hour. The long position would gain $150 (5% * 3000) and the short position would lose $143 ($1000 - $1000 * 0.95^3), netting $7 profit for the skew farmer.*\n\n**Price depreciates**: *Suppose that the hedged position were to undergo a 4.76% decrease (this decrease has an equal likelihood as the 5% increase) in the underlying price in a single hour. The long position would lose $143 (4.76% * 3000) and the short position would gain $151 (1000 * 1.1 skew * (1 - 0.952^3)); a net gain of $8.* \n\nSee that the returns (PnL) for the pool tokens are \"compressed\" using the Power Leverage formula and the PnL for the other position is *greater* as a result. This strategy also works without skew, which we'll explain in more detail in Section 3.\n\n\n## Returns from PnL Compression Alone\n\nThe chart below simulates a spot-hedged skew farmer's performance holding 3S-ETH + ETH spot with no skew and 0% rebalance slippage over 2.6 years. This should demonstrate the profits from PnL compression bias alone:\n\n![Profit-and-loss-compression.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Profit_and_loss_compression_cf13571b39/Profit_and_loss_compression_cf13571b39.png)\n\n\nAll movement in the chart is generated by PnL compression bias. Occasionally it does lead to abrupt losses during hours where the underlying price depreciates rapidly, but the sudden gains are *greater*. \n\nOverall, the strategy generates yield even when the collateral in the pools is equal. You may notice the period between 22k hours to 23k hours is a period of higher yield. This part of the simulation shows the volatile bull run where ETH price went from $650 to $1700 in only 1000 hours. Likewise, the largest loss for the skew farmer (occurring at hour 15248) was when ETH price dropped 9% in a single hour.\n\nThis strategy yields when there's PnL compression; and this compression occurs most often in times of great volatility, especially volatility where the price trends upwards. \n\n\n## Expected Returns\n\nRebalancing the long portion of a delta-hedged position hourly (to cancel out short exposure) will incur a slippage and trading fee expense for the skew farmer – this slippage will impact yield.\n\nThe figure below represents a simulation of skew farming with a spot hedge. It outlines the yield experienced by a skew farmer for various slippages at different pool skew levels. It's reasonable to expect (though we can't guarantee) similar yields. Testing for periods of price depreciation or stasis shows that ETH price decline has a negligible or inconsequential effect on expected return. \n\nThe parameters of the simulation assume hourly rebalancing, 2.6 years of actual ETH price history (starting at $500 and ending at $1700), while holding 3S-ETH and 2.97 * ETH maintained in equal dollar value. No leverage is used on the ETH hedge – meaning 25.2% of capital is 3S-ETH and 74.8% of capital is ETH. The APYs associated with a 32% skew were so significant that they didn't fit within the cell.\n\n**Figure 1 - APY returns associated with spot farming**\n\n![APY-returns-associated-with-spot-farming.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/APY_returns_associated_with_spot_farming_89bc3a2872/APY_returns_associated_with_spot_farming_89bc3a2872.png)\n\n\n# 2. Strategy in Practice\n\n## Remaining Delta-Neutral\n\nThe yields above assume hourly trading around the clock, something that may require a programmed script or bot. It's possible to manually rebalance once per day to get similar gross yields, but net yield is higher because you'd have decreased your slippage expense by lowering the volume traded – but this does include intermittent partial exposure to the underlying price. \n\nFor those choosing to manually rebalance once per day, the steps are: \n\na) Each day, look at the dollar value of your 3S tokens and multiply this number by 3. This is the dollar value of long ETH exposure required to hedge your short exposure. \n\nb) Divide this by the current price of ETH and adjust your ETH holdings on a perpetual swap or spot market to match this number. \n\nPut another way, you're adjusting your underlying holdings to be 3 times the dollar value of your 3 leverage short holdings daily (or as often as you wish).\n\n\n## Utilising Perpetual Swaps\n\nThe yield shown in the chart can usually be increased by using leverage on the long position. It's much more capital efficient to farm this way. There are multiple ways to obtain a leveraged long position; you could use a lending protocol, bank loan, or perpetual swap. \n\nPerpetual swaps have similar interest rates as the other options but offer higher leverage and lower transaction costs. For these reasons, perpetual swaps are the recommended route. \n\nA leveraged position on a perpetual swap increases capital efficiency but comes with the cost of interest via funding rate. Perpetual swaps typically have a funding rate of 0.01% every 8 hours or 11% per year (8766 hours in year * 0.01 / 8 hours funding period). \n\nSuppose a skew farmer expects to get 30% annual yield according to the chart above. They could reduce their capital requirements by using a 10x leverage long position on a perpetual swap. The capital required would be $1300 (1000 3S-ETH + 300 10xETHPERP) rather than $4000 and because yield is measured relative to capital, the yield would be 3.08x as great using this strategy (1/(1300/4000)). Before funding rate expenses, this takes yield from **30% to 92%**. \n\nThe 11% per year expected funding rate applies to the full notional value of the perpetual swap position (which is 10 times higher than the margin used when on 10x leverage). The $300 in margin is thus losing 110% per year. This margin is only 23% (300/1300) of the capital used so, relative to total invested by the skew farmer, the perpetual swap position is costing 27.5% per year (25%*110%). Subtracting the perpetual swap funding rate cost from the gross yield gives a net yield of 64.5%. In summary, the yields shown in Figure 1 can be higher using leverage for the long position.\n\n\n## Balancer Pools\n\nIf you prefer to avoid using a bot or are discouraged by the daily effort it takes to manually skew farm, a simple solution is available. Find the 3 leverage markets with the highest positive rebalancing rate and deposit into the Balancer pool containing the asset. The Balancer pools with greater than 1 leverage are both delta neutral and skew farming. They're also being rebalanced back to delta neutral by arbitrage bots constantly. \n\nOnly half the capital in the Balancer pools is used to farm the skew, so yields will be half of what's shown in the yield chart. While AMM liquidity providers also get the benefit of collecting swap fees from traders, they can lose money through impermanent loss. The unpredictable effect of impermanent loss could exceed the yield from skew farming. Read our [Guide to the Balancer pools](https://tracer.finance/radar/balancer) for more information. \n\n\n# 3. Extended Description of PnL Compression\n\nLet's look again at the example given in Section 1's *Profiting From PnL Compression*: \n\n**Price appreciates**: Suppose the hedged positions described earlier were to experience a 5% increase in the underlying price in a single hour. The long position would gain $150 (5% * 3000), and the short position would lose $143 ($1000 - $1000 * 0.95^3) netting $7 profit for the skew farmer.\n\n**Price depreciates**: Suppose that the hedged position were to undergo a 4.76% decrease (this decrease has an equal likelihood as the 5% increase) in the underlying price in a single hour. The long position would lose $143 (4.76% * 3000) and the short position would gain $151 (1000 * 1.1 skew * (1 - 0.952^3)); a net gain of $8.\n\nThe second trade was only profitable because of skew. With equal collateral between sides (no skew), PnL compression alone would cause a $137 gain by the short position. That's a $6 net loss for the skew farmer.\n\nOutside of overhead costs like slippage, the PnL compression effect of power leverage is the only reason a skew farmer risks losing money. However, when there's no skew, one outcome (price appreciates) results in a $7 profit and the other (price depreciates) a $6 loss. This $1 discrepancy in favour of the skew farmer illustrates why, even with equal collateral in the pools, skew farmers still generate yield overall, from PnL compression. \n\nThe rare exposure to the underlying as a result of PnL compression means that skew-farming can't be labelled as having no price risk, though with appropriate options hedging, you could negate this price risk. \n\nThe occasional PnL compression means that both 3S-ETH and 3L-ETH tokens actually have an average leverage of 2.97 (as determined by analysing 2.6 years of ETH price history). Accordingly, a more exact hedge should use 2.97 times the exposure instead of 3, despite the token being labeled a 3 leverage token.\n\n\n### **Distribution of PnL Compression for different Leverages**\n\n![Distribution-of-PnL-Compression-for-different-Leverages.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Distribution_of_Pn_L_Compression_for_different_Leverages_12ee150b9d/Distribution_of_Pn_L_Compression_for_different_Leverages_12ee150b9d.png)\n\nIf you are interested in farming the excess risk-adjusted returns opportunity that pool skew presents, but require more information to do so, join the **[Tracer Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tracerdao)** to get in contact with the team or community.\n\nYou can also find our [Skew Farming Guide here](https://tracer.finance/radar/skew-farming-guide).","description":"What is skew farming and how exactly does it work?

Tracer is not just Perpetual Pools; it's a full-fledged ecosystem of standardised financial products.\n\n# **The Tracer Product Suite**\n\nTo illustrate the power of Tracer, the below infographic divides Tracer into two layers; the Factory Layer and the Product Layer. The third element is the ecosystem in which Tracer operates, integrates and builds. In this article, we'll unpack the infographic by examining the product suite components one by one and then give an example of their practical applications.\n\n![Tracer_Factory.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Factory_D01_04e_01_15aa4f36fc/Tracer_Factory_D01_04e_01_15aa4f36fc.png)\n\n---\n\n## **The Factory Layer**\n\nThe Factory Layer is the set of components and applications that let anyone build on top of Tracer's products. It's the part of Tracer that'll put every other permissionless protocol to shame.\n\n**The first aspect of the Tracer Factory that we'll look at is the Data Factory.** This allows *anyone* to take any data feed (or multiple data feeds) and transform them into a standardised Tracer Data Feed, which can be used across Tracer or other DeFi applications. \n\nTracer Data Feed might, for example, take off-chain weather data from multiple weather stations and use adapters to create a weather data feed for a particular location. Or it might divide the price of Bitcoin with the price of Ethereum to derive a flippening data feed. The point is that it can take any data, transform it in any way, and produce a single data feed that may be applied to any financial or non-financial product. *This is critically powerful.*\n\n**The second aspect in the Factory Layer, Tracer Factory,** allows *anyone* to deploy any Tracer Data Feed to any Tracer product. For example, if you wanted to create an options market for greenhouse gas emissions, all you'd need to do is go to the factory, select the proper Tracer Data Feed and click \"Create a Tracer Options -market\". Simple.\n\n**The third aspect of the Factory Layer is the Template Factory** – this allows *anyone* to add a new financial product to the Tracer ecosystem. Its input is a team of hard-working developers and its output are financial products like an options platform or a novel financial initiative. The contributing team splits trading and/or other fees with the Tracer DAO and gets to leverage the Tracer ecosystem to bootstrap their project. The DAO introduces new products to the Tracer ecosystem, given they are factory compatible, i.e. compatible with Tracer Data Feeds and the Tracer Factory.\n\nThese three segments make up the ingenuity that is the *Tracer Factory Layer*. \n\n![Tracer-Factory-Layer.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Factory_Layer_7ec7e04726/Tracer_Factory_Layer_7ec7e04726.png)\n\n---\n\n## **The Product Layer**\n\nThe Product Layer is the set of components in the Tracer ecosystem that lets users interact with and view different financial markets or data feeds.\n\n**Tracer Perpetual Pools** lets *anyone* take a tokenised, leveraged, non-liquidatable short or long position in any market. For example, if you were confident we'd reached the maximum average global temperature, you could mint 10x short global temperature tokens.\n\nThe Product Layer can consist of as many financial products as the contributors to the DAO decide to make. Other current product initiatives include options and swaps. Tracer also intends to continue to grow its data feed ecosystem. If you think you or your team can build a new financial product on Tracer, please reach out to me.\n\n![Tracer-product-layer.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_product_layer_6fc3fd5a11/Tracer_product_layer_6fc3fd5a11.png)\n\n---\n\n## **The Ecosystem**\n\nThe ecosystem comprises all the use cases for Tracer Data Feeds, tokenised positions, and inputs to the Tracer ecosystem. For example, as a protocol, you might want to use Tracer Data Feeds to power a swaps agreement. Or you might want to use inflation short/long tokens from Perpetual Pools to build a simple inflation betting site. The possibilities are truly endless and go far beyond DeFi. \n\nSome day the Bank of America might want to package and sell their mortgages via Tracer. The infrastructure we're building, growing and designing has myriad applications across disparate industries, local and global, that are flexible, easy to utilise and will rework the fundamentals of how we understand and interact with markets and each other, moving forward. \n\n![TracerFactory_D01_04e-01 (1).png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/Tracer_Factory_D01_04e_01_1_3fd7401a45/Tracer_Factory_D01_04e_01_1_3fd7401a45.png)\n\n\n---\n\n# A p**ractical case study**\n\nHere's a practical example that showcases how you'd solve a real-world problem using the Tracer product suite; following data from its point of origin all the way through to the final outcome. Let's get into it!\n\nImagine you're an Uber driver in say, Helsinki. Your income is determined by how many passengers you get. Your expenses are determined by how many kilometres you drive. To reduce the volatility of your net income, you'd like to hedge the price you pay for fuel each month, knowing you drive around 7000 kilometres in any given month. With your car, this equates to about 350 litres of fuel each month.\n\nWith this in mind, you could ensure that you pay exactly 550€ per month for fuel, instead of the vague amount between 480–620€ that you're used to. The traditional financial system fails you here. In Helsinki there are no fuel derivatives markets and even if there were, the minimum contract size wouldn't be feasible for you.  \n\nAn entrepreneurial oracle operator notices that the fuel pricing data is widely available for the Helsinki region but isn't on-chain yet, so they decide to bring each of the petrol stations' fuel prices on-chain as oracle feeds, knowing there's demand for the data.\n\nAs the Uber driver, you:\n\n1. Go to the Tracer Data Factory and set up a \"Helsinki Fuel Price\" Tracer Data Feed, which creates a fuel price index based on the volume sold at each pump. \n\n2. You then go to the Tracer Factory and deploy a new Tracer Perpetual Pool with the Tracer Data Feed. This produces ERC-20 short & long tokens representing Helsinki Fuel Price.\n\nTo hedge your fuel consumption, you can buy long Helsinki Fuel Price tokens, ensuring that the token appreciation covers the losses from increasing fuel prices. \n\nWhen enough drivers demand the feature, Uber includes a *HEDGE NOW*  button on their interface, which locks in the effective fuel price for its drivers.\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\nThe Tracer model is mind-bogglingly powerful. We're not just building a single financial contract. We're building financial infrastructure that's inter-compatible with any software. You can use it to power your project, you can build on top of it, you can integrate it, or you can use it natively at [tracer.finance](https://tracer.finance/). There's something for everyone.

First, let's understand how we structured the Balancer pools and the assumption on which their composition was based.\n\n*3p is a quoting convention for the market's power leverage multiplier. It is used in place of 3x, though is approximately equivalent in most circumstances. \n\n### Skew Farming\n\nWhen Perpetual Pools are skewed, meaning that one side holds more USDC than the other, the leverage on gains is different for long and short but remains the same for losses. We call this effect polarised leverage, and it's displayed on the UI like this:\n\n![balancer-pools.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/mycelium-bucket/balancer_pools_1e2525cb35/balancer_pools_1e2525cb35.png)\n\n\nWe can exploit this polarised leverage to **earn excess risk-adjusted returns**, using a strategy that either a) holds an equal notional value of short pool tokens and the underlying asset when skew > 1, or b) holds an equal notional value of long pool tokens and a short position on the underlying asset when skew < 1. Note that we calculate skew as *long TVL / short TVL*.\n\nThis strategy is called skew farming. It's similar to basis farming on products like perpetual swaps. Like funding rates for perpetual swaps, the polarised leverage for gains favours the side of pool that is less demanded by traders, which we assume is the short side most always. This is the case historically if you observe perpetual swap funding rates. \n\nSkew is the indicator of long/short demand for Perpetual Pools. As previously stated, we can hold a combination of the underlying asset and short Pool tokens while skew is > 1 to earn what is essentially interest from the long side of the Pool. Our assumption that skew would generally be > 1 led us to choose the following composition for the 3p Balancer AMM pools:\n\n### Balancer pool composition\n\n3-ETH/USD Weighted Pool: **50% wETH, 33.33% 3Short, 16.67% 3Long**\n\n3-BTC/USD Weighted Pool: **50% wBTC, 33.33% 3Short, 16.67% 3Long** \n\n\nLet’s dissect these weightings. The greater proportion of 3-Short tokens leaves the Balancer pool with a short exposure of 3 x (33.33 -16.67) = 50% which hedges the 50% long exposure presented by the underlying assets in the pool. This is what leads us to describe these pools as delta-neutral *and skew-farming*. \n\nThe delta-neutral description holds when the Perpetual Pools have equal TVL in each side or, in other words, the skew = 1. When the skew is > 1, the short pool token losses hedge the wETH or wBTC gains (depending on the balancer pool), but actually have gains that exceed the losses experienced by the underlying assets. That’s why the Balancer pools are described as skew-farming. \n\nThis is good for LPs. In upwards trending markets, value accrues to their position automatically every time the short tokens receive the value transfer. But what happens if skew is less than one (1 <)?\n\nHerein lies the oversight. While skew is < 1, the Balancer pools are long exposed. During a market downturn (or a crash), traders shift their positions in the Perpetual Pools from the long side to the short, causing the leverage multiple for short positions to drop below 3. In some cases, we observed the leverage multiple for the short tokens drop as low as 1.8 during the 4th Dec. market downturn. When this happened, the gains made by the short tokens were unable to fully hedge the losses experienced by the underlying assets in the Balancer pools. This design flaw contributed to LP losses over that period. \n\n### Other Factors\n\nBalancer pool LPs may experience losses for a number of other reasons, among them impermanent loss (IL) and the volatility decay of their leveraged tokens (though this effect is far less pronounced).\n\nUsually, AMMs like the Balancer pools reach an equilibrium where the capital supplied to the pools meets the natural demand for the assets (trading activity). This is the point where the swap fees generated (minus IL) returns a certain yield for LPs. However, the yield LPs have been earning to date – in the form of TCR rewards – is artificial. This has encouraged more supply than is demanded, which exacerbates the aforementioned effects. Now that the emissions of TCR, and the TCR price itself, is in decline, LPs are barely breaking-even. \n\nIf there existed natural trading activity, the Balancer pools may be able to generate sufficient swap fees to compensate LPs at the current levels of capital. We have observed that most of the trading activity, however, is (necessary) arbitrage rather than organic demand. \n\n### Moving Forward\n\nWe have recently made changes to the [pools.tracer.finance](http://pools.tracer.finance) UI to direct trading activity primarily to the Balancer pools, which we believe is the best market for retail investors to buy and sell Tracer’s leveraged tokens. This change will hopefully stimulate trading on these secondary markets and boost the swap fees for LPs. \n\nWe are still exploring a number of options to mitigate LP losses during market pullbacks, including tweaks to the current composition of the pools to reduce exposure to the underlying during such periods. It’s worth saying that the Balancer team has been extremely helpful while we investigate the capabilities of their platform, and we hope to present a solution very soon.","description":"Balancer pool LPs may experience losses for a number of other reasons, among them impermanent loss (IL) and the volatility decay of their leveraged tokens (though this effect is far less pronounced).
